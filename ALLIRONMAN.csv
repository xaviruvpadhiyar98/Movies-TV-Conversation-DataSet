0,Tony Stark,"I feel like you're driving me to a court-martial. This is crazy. What did I do? I feel like you're going to pull over and snuff me. What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forrest!"
1,Soldier,"We can talk, sir."
2,Tony Stark,"Oh, I see. So it's personal?"
3,Soldier,"No, you intimidate them."
4,Tony Stark,"Good God, you're a woman. I honestly... I couldn't have called that. I mean, I'd apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first."
5,Soldier,I'm an airman.
6,Tony Stark,"Well you have, actually, excellent bone structure, there. I'm kind of having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird?  Come on, it's okay, laugh."
7,Soldier,"Sir, I have a question to ask."
8,Tony Stark,"Yes, please."
9,Soldier,Is it true you went 12 for 12 with last year's Maxim cover models?
10,Tony Stark,"That is an excellent question. Yes and no. March and I had a scheduling conflict, but fortunately, the Christmas cover was twins. Anything else?  You're kidding me with the hand up, right?"
11,Soldier,Is it cool if I take a picture with you?
12,Tony Stark,"Yes. It's very cool.  Please, no gang signs. No, throw it up. I'm kidding. Yeah, peace. I love peace. I'd be out of a job with peace."
13,Soldier,Come on. Hurry up. Just click it. Don't change any settings. Just click it.
14,Tony Stark,What's going on?
15,Soldier,Contact left!
16,Tony Stark,What have we got?
17,Soldier,"Jimmy, stay with Stark!"
18,Soldier,Stay down!
19,Tony Stark,Yeah.
20,Soldier,Son of a bitch!
21,Tony Stark,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!"
22,Soldier,Stay here!
23,"[Jimmy turned back around and he was gunned down too, holes piercing the vehicle. Tony's hearing and senses were dulled a bit as he got himself out of the vehicle, stumbling a bit in the chaos. He got some of his hearing back and ran and dove behind a rock for cover. He pulled out his phone to contact and call for help when a bomb landed next to him. He looked over to see it say","Stark Industries. He tried to get up and get away, but didn't in time. The bomb exploded and made him fly through the air a bit.]"
24,Tony Stark,Whoa!
25,Voice over,"Tony Stark. Visionary. Genius. American patriot. Even from an early age, the son of legendary weapons developer Howard Stark quickly stole the spotlight with his brilliant and unique mind. At age four, he built his first circuit board. At age six, his first engine. And at 17, he graduated summa cum laude from MIT. Then, the passing of a titan. Howard Stark's lifelong friend and ally, Obadiah Stane, steps in to help fill the gap left by the legendary founder, until, at age 21, the prodigal son returns and is anointed the new CEO of Stark Industries. With the keys to the kingdom, Tony ushers in a new era for his father's legacy, creating smarter weapons, advanced robotics, satellite targeting. Today, Tony Stark has changed the face of the weapons industry by ensuring freedom and protecting America and her interests around the globe."
26,James Rhodes,"As liaison to Stark Industries, I've had the unique privilege of serving with a real patriot. He is my friend and he is my great mentor. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to present this year's Apogee Award to Mr. Tony Stark. Tony?"
27,Obadiah Stane,"Thank you, Colonel."
28,James Rhodes,Thanks for the save.
29,Obadiah Stane,"This is beautiful. Thank you. Thank you all very much. This is wonderful. Well, I'm not Tony Stark. But if I were Tony, I would tell you how honored I feel and what a joy it is to receive this very prestigious award. Tony, you know...The best thing about Tony is also the worst thing. He's always working."
30,Tony Stark,Work it! Come on! We should just stay till the morning.
31,James Rhodes,You are unbelievable.
32,Tony Stark,"Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?"
33,James Rhodes,Nobody roped me into anything!
34,Tony Stark,I'm so sorry.
35,James Rhodes,"But they told me that if I presented you with an award, you'd be deeply honored."
36,Tony Stark,"Of course I'd be deeply honored. And it's you, that's great. So, when do we do it?"
37,James Rhodes,It's right here. Here you go.
38,Tony Stark,There it is. That was easy. I'm so sorry.
39,James Rhodes,"Yeah, it's okay."
40,Tony Stark,"Wow! Would you look at that? That's something else. I don't have any of those floating around. Uh, we're gonna let it ride! Give me a hand, will you? Give me a little something-something."
41,James Rhodes,I don't blow on a man's dice.
42,Tony Stark,"Come on, honey bear."
43,James Rhodes,I don't blow on a man's dice.
44,Tony Stark,There it is. Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...
45,Dealer,Two craps. Line away.
46,James Rhodes,That's what happens.
47,Tony Stark,"Worse things have happened. I think we're gonna be fine. Color me up, will ya?"
48,James Rhodes,This is where I exit.
49,Tony Stark,All right.
50,James Rhodes,"Tomorrow, don't be late."
51,Tony Stark,"Yeah, you can count on it."
52,James Rhodes,I'm serious!
53,Tony Stark,"I know, I know.  Render unto Caesar, that which is Caesar's. There you go."
54,Christine Everhart,"Mr. Stark! Excuse me, Mr. Stark! Christine Everhart, Vanity Fair magazine. Can I ask you a couple of questions?"
55,Happy Hogan,She's cute.
56,Tony Stark,She's all right?  Hi.
57,Christine Everhart,Hi.
58,Tony Stark,Yeah. Okay--
59,Christine Everhart,It's okay?
60,Tony Stark,Go.
61,Christine Everhart,You've been called the da Vinci of our time. What do you say to that?
62,Tony Stark,Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.
63,Christine Everhart,"And what do you say to your other nickname? ""The Merchant of Death""?"
64,Tony Stark,That's not bad. Let me guess. Berkeley?
65,Christine Everhart,"Brown, actually."
66,Tony Stark,"Well, Ms. Brown. It's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we've got. I guarantee you, the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals."
67,Christine Everhart,You rehearse that much?
68,Tony Stark,Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime.
69,Christine Everhart,I can see that.
70,Tony Stark,I'd like to show you first-hand.
71,Christine Everhart,All I want is a serious answer.
72,Tony Stark,"Okay, here's serious. My old man had a philosophy, ""Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy."""
73,Christine Everhart,That's a great line coming from the guy selling the sticks.
74,Tony Stark,"My father helped defeat the Nazis. He worked on the Manhattan Project. A lot of people, including your professors at Brown, would call that being a hero."
75,Christine Everhart,And a lot of people would also call that war profiteering.
76,Tony Stark,"Tell me, do you plan to report on the millions we've saved by advancing medical technology or kept from starvation with our intelli-crops? All those breakthroughs, military funding, honey."
77,Christine Everhart,You ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life?
78,Tony Stark,I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.
79,JARVIS,Good morning. It's 7:00 a.m. The weather in Malibu is 72 degrees with scattered clouds. The surf conditions are fair with waist-to-shoulder high lines. High tide will be at 10:52 a.m.
80,Christine Everhart,
81,JARVIS,You are not authorized to access this area.
82,Christine Everhart,Jesus.
83,Pepper Potts,"That's JARVIS. He runs the house. I've got your clothes here. They've been dry-cleaned and pressed, and there's a car waiting for you outside that will take you anywhere you'd like to go."
84,Christine Everhart,You must be the famous Pepper Potts.
85,Pepper Potts,Indeed I am.
86,Christine Everhart,"After all these years, Tony still has you picking up the dry-cleaning."
87,Pepper Potts,"I do anything and everything that Mr. Stark requires, including, occasionally, taking out the trash. Will that be all?"
88,Tony Stark,Give me an exploded view.
89,JARVIS,The compression in cylinder three appears to be low.
90,Tony Stark,Log that.
91,Pepper Potts,"I'm gonna try again, right now."
92,Tony Stark,Please don't turn down my music.
93,Pepper Potts,I'll keep you posted.  You are supposed to be halfway around the world right now.
94,Tony Stark,How'd she take it?
95,Pepper Potts,Like a champ.
96,Tony Stark,Why are you trying to hustle me out of here?
97,Pepper Potts,Your flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago.
98,Tony Stark,"That's funny, I thought with it being my plane and all, that it would just wait for me to get there."
99,Pepper Potts,"Tony, I need to speak to you about a couple things before I get you out of the door."
100,Tony Stark,"I mean, doesn't it kind of defeat the whole purpose of having your own plane if it departs before you arrive?"
101,Pepper Potts,Larry called. He's got another buyer for the Jackson Pollock in the wings. Do you want it? Yes or no.
102,Tony Stark,Is it a good representation of his spring period?
103,Pepper Potts,"Um, no. The Springs was actually the neighborhood in East Hampton where he lived and worked--"
104,Tony Stark,So?
105,Pepper Potts,"--not ""spring"" like the season. I think it's a fair example. Um.. I think it's incredibly overpriced."
106,Tony Stark,I need it. Buy it. Store it.
107,Pepper Potts,Okay. The MIT commencement speech...
108,Tony Stark,"Is in June. Please, don't harangue me about stuff that's way, way, down..."
109,Pepper Potts,"Well, they're haranguing me, so I'm gonna say yes."
110,Tony Stark,Deflect it and absorb it. Don't transmit it back to me.
111,Pepper Potts,I need you to sign this before you get on the plane.
112,Tony Stark,"What are you trying to get rid of me for? What, you got plans?"
113,Pepper Potts,"As a matter of fact, I do."
114,Tony Stark,I don't like it when you have plans.
115,Pepper Potts,I'm allowed to have plans on my birthday.
116,Tony Stark,It's your birthday?
117,Pepper Potts,Yes.
118,Tony Stark,I knew that. Already?
119,Pepper Potts,Yeah. Isn't that strange? It's the same day as last year.
120,Tony Stark,"Well, get yourself something nice from me."
121,Pepper Potts,I already did.
122,Tony Stark,And?
123,Pepper Potts,"Oh, it was very nice."
124,Tony Stark,Yeah.
125,Pepper Potts,"Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark."
126,Tony Stark,"You're welcome, Miss Potts... Okay."
127,Tony Stark,You're good. I thought I lost you back there.
128,Happy,"You did, sir.  I had to cut across Mulholland."
129,Tony Stark,I got you. I got you.
130,James Rhodes,What's wrong with you?
131,Tony Stark,What?
132,James Rhodes,Three hours.
133,Tony Stark,I got caught doing a piece for Vanity Fair.
134,James Rhodes,For three hours. For three hours you got me standing here.
135,Tony Stark,Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on. Wheels up! Rock and roll!
136,Tony Stark,"What you reading, platypus?"
137,James Rhodes,Nothing.
138,Tony Stark,"Come on, sour patch."
139,James Rhodes,I'm not sour.
140,Tony Stark,Don't be mad.
141,James Rhodes,"I told you, I'm not mad. I'm indifferent, okay?"
142,Tony Stark,I said I was sorry.
143,Flight Attendant #1,"Good morning, Mr. Stark."
144,James Rhodes,You don't need to apologize to me.
145,Tony Stark,I told you I was sorry.
146,James Rhodes,I'm your man.
147,Tony Stark,"Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he..."
148,James Rhodes,I'm just indifferent right now.
149,Flight Attendant #1,Hot towel?
150,James Rhodes,"You don't respect yourself, so I know you don't respect me."
151,Tony Stark,I respect you.
152,James Rhodes,"I'm just your babysitter. So, when you need your diaper changed...  Thank you. Let me know and I'll get you a bottle, okay?"
153,Tony Stark,"Hey! Heat up the sake, will you? Thanks for reminding me."
154,James Rhodes,"No, I'm not talking... We're not drinking. We're working right now."
155,Tony Stark,You can't have sashimi without sake.
156,James Rhodes,You are constitutionally incapable of being responsible.
157,Tony Stark,It would be irresponsible not to drink. I'm just talking about a nightcap.
158,Flight Attendant #2,Hot sake?
159,Tony Stark,"Yes, two, please."
160,James Rhodes,No. Just-- I'm not drinking. I don't want any.
161,James Rhodes,"That's what I'm talking about. When I get up in the morning and I'm putting on my uniform, you know what I recognize? I see in that mirror that every person that's got this uniform on got my back!"
162,Tony Stark,"Hey, you know what? I'm not like you. I'm not cut out..."
163,James Rhodes,"No, no. You don't have to be like me! But you're more than what you are."
164,Tony Stark,Can you excuse me if I'm a bit distracted here?
165,James Rhodes,No! You can't be distracted right now! Listen to me!
166,Tony Stark,General.
167,General,"Welcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward to your weapons presentation."
168,Tony Stark,Thanks.
169,Tony Stark,"Is it better to be feared or respected? I say, is it too much to ask for both? With that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel of Stark Industries' Freedom Line. It's the first missile system to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology. They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire. I respectfully disagree. I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once. That's how Dad did it. That's how America does it. And it's worked out pretty well so far. Find an excuse to let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee you the bad guys won't even want to come out of their caves."
170,Tony Stark,
171,Obadiah Stane,Tony.
172,Tony Stark,"Obie, what are you doing up?"
173,Obadiah Stane,I couldn't sleep till I found out how it went. How'd it go?
174,Tony Stark,It went great. Looks like it's gonna be an early Christmas.
175,Obadiah Stane,"Hey! Way to go, my boy! I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?"
176,Tony Stark,Why aren't you wearing those pajamas I got you?
177,Obadiah Stane,"Good night, Tony."
178,James Rhodes,"Hey, Tony."
179,Tony Stark,"I'm sorry, this is the ""fun-vee."" The ""hum-drum-vee"" is back there."
180,James Rhodes,Nice job.
181,Tony Stark,See you back at base.
182,Yinsen,I wouldn't do that if I were you.
183,Tony Stark,What the hell did you do to me?
184,Yinsen,"What I did? What I did is to save your life. I removed all the shrapnel I could, but there's a lot left, and it's headed into your atrial septum. Here, want to see?  I've seen many wounds like that in my village. We call them the walking dead because it takes about a week for the barbs to reach the vital organs."
185,Tony Stark,What is this?
186,Yinsen,"That is an electromagnet, hooked up to a car battery, and it's keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart. Hmm?  That's right. Smile. We met once, you know, at a technical conference in Bern."
187,Tony Stark,I don't remember.
188,Yinsen,"No, you wouldn't. If I had been that drunk, I wouldn't have been able to stand, much less give a lecture on integrated circuits."
189,Tony Stark,Where are we?
190,Yinsen,"Come on, stand up. Stand up! Just do as I do. Come on, put your hands up."
191,Tony Stark,Those are my guns. How did they get my guns?
192,Yinsen,Do you understand me? Do as I do.  This one.
193,Tony Stark,I refuse.
194,Pepper Potts,Tony!
195,Yinsen,He wants to know what you think.
196,Tony Stark,I think you got a lot of my weapons.
197,Yinsen,"He says they have everything you need to build the Jericho missile. He wants you to make the list of materials.  He says for you to start working immediately, and when you're done, he will set you free."
198,Tony Stark,"No, he won't."
199,Yinsen,"No, he won't."
200,Yinsen,"I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark. But they will never find you in these mountains. Look, what you just saw, that is your legacy, Stark. Your life's work, in the hands of those murderers. Is that how you want to go out? Is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stark? Or are you going to do something about it?"
201,Tony Stark,"Why should I do anything? They're going to kill me, you, either way. And if they don't, I'll probably be dead in a week."
202,Yinsen,"Well, then, this is a very important week for you, isn't it? Hm?"
203,Tony Stark,How many languages do you speak?
204,Yinsen,"A lot. But apparently, not enough for this place. They speak Arabic, Urdu, Dari, Pashto, Mongolian, Farsi, Russian."
205,Tony Stark,Who are these people?
206,Yinsen,"They are your loyal customers, sir. They call themselves the Ten Rings.  You know, we might be more productive if you include me in the planning process."
207,Tony Stark,"Uh-huh.  Okay, we don't need this."
208,Yinsen,What is that?
209,Tony Stark,"That's palladium, 0.15 grams. We need at least 1.6, so why don't you go break down the other 11?"
210,Man #1,What's he doing?
211,Man #2,Working.
212,Tony Stark,"Careful. Careful, we only get one shot at this."
213,Yinsen,Relax. I have steady hands. Why do you think you're still alive?
214,Tony Stark,What do I call you?
215,Yinsen,My name is Yinsen.
216,Tony Stark,Yinsen. Nice to meet you.
217,Yinsen,"Nice to meet you, too.  Whoa. That doesn't look like a Jericho missile."
218,Tony Stark,That's because it's a miniaturized arc reactor. I got a big one powering my factory at home. It should keep the shrapnel out of my heart.
219,Yinsen,But what could it generate?
220,Tony Stark,"If my math is right, and it always is, three gigajoules per second."
221,Yinsen,That could run your heart for 50 lifetimes.
222,Tony Stark,Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.
223,Tony Stark,This is our ticket out of here.
224,Yinsen,What is it?
225,Tony Stark,Flatten them out and look.
226,Yinsen,"Oh, wow. Impressive."
227,Yinsen,Good. Good roll. Good roll.
228,Tony Stark,You still haven't told me where you're from.
229,Yinsen,I'm from a small town called Gulmira. It's actually a nice place.
230,Tony Stark,Got a family?
231,Yinsen,"Yes, and I will see them when I leave here. And you, Stark?"
232,Tony Stark,No.
233,Yinsen,No? So you're a man who has everything and nothing.
234,Man #1,It doesn't look anything like the picture.
235,Man #2,Maybe it's been modified.
236,Man #1,The tail is wrong.
237,Man #2,It's just backwards.
238,Raza,Relax.  Why have you failed me?
239,Yinsen,We're working. Diligently.
240,Raza,
241,Yinsen,It's very complex. He's trying very hard.
242,Raza,On his knees.
243,Yinsen,We're both working.
244,Raza,Open your mouth.
245,Tony Stark,What does he want?
246,Raza,You think I'm a fool? What's going on? Tell me the truth.
247,Yinsen,He's building your Jericho. He's building your Jericho.
248,Tony Stark,What do you want? A delivery date?  I need him. Good assistant.
249,Raza,You have till tomorrow to assemble my missile.
250,Yinsen,"Okay? Can you move? Okay, say it again."
251,Tony Stark,"41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps, that's from the door, fork right, 33 steps, turn right."
252,Raza,Where is Stark?
253,Man,He was here a moment ago.
254,Raza,Go look for him.
255,Man,Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!
256,Tony Stark,Say something. Say something back to him.
257,Yinsen,He's speaking Hungarian. I don't...
258,Tony Stark,Then speak Hungarian.
259,Yinsen,Okay. I know.
260,Tony Stark,What do you know?
261,Tony Stark,How'd that work?
262,Yinsen,"Oh, my goodness. It worked all right."
263,Tony Stark,That's what I do.
264,Yinsen,Let me finish this.
265,Tony Stark,Initialize the power sequence.
266,Yinsen,Okay.
267,Tony Stark,Now!
268,Yinsen,Tell me. Tell me.
269,Tony Stark,Function 11. Tell me when you see a progress bar. It should be up right now.
270,Yinsen,Yes.
271,Tony Stark,Talk to me. Tell me when you see it.
272,Yinsen,I have it.
273,Tony Stark,"Press Control ""l""."
274,Yinsen,"""I."""
275,Tony Stark,"""I."" ""Enter."""
276,Yinsen,Got it.
277,Tony Stark,"""l"" and ""Enter."" Come over here and button me up."
278,Yinsen,Okay. All right.
279,Tony Stark,Every other hex bolt.
280,Yinsen,They're coming!
281,Tony Stark,"Nothing pretty, just get it done. Just get it done."
282,Yinsen,They're coming.
283,Tony Stark,"Make sure the checkpoints are clear before you follow me out, okay?"
284,Yinsen,"We need more time. Hey, I'm gonna go buy you some time."
285,Tony Stark,Stick to the plan! Stick to the plan!  Yinsen! Yinsen!
286,Tony Stark,Yinsen!
287,Yinsen,Watch out!  Stark.
288,Tony Stark,"Come on.  We got to go. Move for me, come on. We got a plan. We're gonna stick to it."
289,Yinsen,"This was always the plan, Stark."
290,Tony Stark,"Come on, you're gonna go see your family. Get up."
291,Yinsen,"My family is dead. I'm going to see them now, Stark. It's okay. I want this. I want this."
292,Tony Stark,Thank you for saving me.
293,Yinsen,Don't waste it. Don't waste your life.
294,Tony Stark,My turn.  Not bad.
295,Tony Stark,Hey!  Hey!
296,James Rhodes,"How was the ""fun-vee""? Next time, you ride with me, okay?"
297,James Rhodes,"Watch it, coming up here."
298,Tony Stark,Are you kidding me with this? Get rid of them.  Your eyes are red. A few tears for your long-lost boss?
299,Pepper Potts,Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.
300,Tony Stark,"Yeah, vacation's over."
301,Happy,"Where to, sir?"
302,Pepper Potts,"Take us to the hospital, please, Happy."
303,Tony Stark,No.
304,Pepper Potts,"No? Tony, you have to go to the hospital."
305,Tony Stark,No is a complete answer.
306,Pepper Potts,The doctor has to look at you.
307,Tony Stark,"I don't have to do anything. I've been in captivity for three months. There are two things I want to do. I want an American cheeseburger, and the other..."
308,Pepper Potts,That's enough of that.
309,Tony Stark,...is not what you think. I want you to call for a press conference now.
310,Pepper Potts,Call for a press conference?
311,Tony Stark,Yeah.
312,Pepper Potts,What on earth for?
313,Tony Stark,"Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first."
314,Obadiah Stane,Look at this! Tony. We were going to meet at the hospital.
315,Tony Stark,"No, I'm fine."
316,Obadiah Stane,"Look at you! You had to have a burger, yeah?"
317,Tony Stark,"Well, come on."
318,Obadiah Stane,You get me one of those?
319,Tony Stark,There's only one left. I need it.
320,Obadiah Stane,"Hey, look who's here! Yeah!"
321,Agent Coulson,Miss Potts?
322,Pepper Potts,Yes.
323,Agent Coulson,Can I speak to you for a moment?
324,Pepper Potts,"I'm not part of the press conference, but it's about to begin right now."
325,Agent Coulson,"I'm not a reporter. I'm Agent Phil Coulson, with the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division."
326,Pepper Potts,That's quite a mouthful.
327,Agent Coulson,I know. We're working on it.
328,Pepper Potts,"You know, we've been approached already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA..."
329,Agent Coulson,We're a separate division with a more specific focus. We need to debrief Mr. Stark about the circumstances of his escape.
330,Pepper Potts,"I'll put something in the book, shall I?"
331,Agent Coulson,Thank you.
332,Obadiah Stane,"Well, let's get this started, uh..."
333,Tony Stark,"Hey, would it be all right if everyone sat down?"
334,James Rhodes,What's up with the love-in?
335,Pepper Potts,Don't look at me. I don't know what he's up to.
336,Tony Stark,Good to see you.
337,Obadiah Stane,Good to see you.
338,Tony Stark,"I never got to say goodbye to Dad. I never got to say goodbye to my father. There's questions that I would have asked him. I would have asked him how he felt about what this company did. If he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts. Or maybe he was every inch the man we all remember from the newsreels. I saw young Americans killed by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them. And I saw that I had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero accountability."
339,Reporters,Mr. Stark!
340,Tony Stark,"Hey, Ben."
341,Reporter,What happened over there?
342,Tony Stark,I had my eyes opened.  until such a time as I can decide what the future of the company will be.
343,Obadiah Stane,I think we're gonna be selling a lot of newspapers.
344,Tony Stark,"What direction it should take, one that I'm comfortable with and is consistent with the highest good for this country, as well."
345,Obadiah Stane,What we should take away from this is that Tony's back! And he's healthier than ever. We're going to have a little internal discussion and we'll get back to you with the follow-up.  Where is he?
346,Happy,He's inside.
347,Obadiah Stane,"Well, that..uh... That went well."
348,Tony Stark,Did I just paint a target on the back of my head?
349,Obadiah Stane,Your head? What about my head? What do you think the over-under on the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?
350,Tony Stark,"Uh, optimistically, 40 points."
351,Obadiah Stane,At minimum.
352,Tony Stark,Yep.
353,Obadiah Stane,"Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer."
354,Tony Stark,"Obie, I just don't want a body count to be our only legacy."
355,Obadiah Stane,That's what we do. We're iron mongers. We make weapons.
356,Tony Stark,It's my name on the side of the building.
357,Obadiah Stane,And what we do keeps the world from falling into chaos.
358,Tony Stark,Not based on what I saw. We're not doing a good enough job. We can do better. We're gonna do something else.
359,Obadiah Stane,Like what? You want us to make baby bottles?
360,Tony Stark,I think we should take another look into arc reactor technology.
361,Obadiah Stane,"Ah, come on. The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt! Tony, come on. We built that thing to shut the hippies up."
362,Tony Stark,It works.
363,Obadiah Stane,"Yeah, as a science project. The arc was never cost effective. We knew that before we built it. Arc reactor technology, that's a dead end, right?"
364,Tony Stark,Maybe.
365,Obadiah Stane,Huh? Am I right? We haven't had a breakthrough in that in what? Thirty years.
366,Tony Stark,"That's what they say. Could you have a lousier poker face? Just tell me, who told you?"
367,Obadiah Stane,Never mind who told me. Show me.
368,Tony Stark,It's Rhodey or Pepper.
369,Obadiah Stane,I want to see it.
370,Tony Stark,"Okay, Rhodey."
371,Obadiah Stane,Okay.
372,Tony Stark,Okay? It works.
373,Obadiah Stane,"Listen to me, Tony. We're a team. Do you understand? There's nothing we can't do if we stick together, like your father and I."
374,Tony Stark,"I'm sorry I didn't give you a heads-up, okay? But if I had..."
375,Obadiah Stane,"Tony. Tony, no more of this ""ready, fire, aim"" business. You understand me?"
376,Tony Stark,That was Dad's line.
377,Obadiah Stane,You gotta let me handle this. We're gonna have to play a whole different kind of ball now. We're going to have to take a lot of heat. I want you to promise me that you're gonna lay low.
378,Newcaster,"Stark Industries! I've got one recommendation! Ready? Ready? Sell, sell, sell! Abandon ship! Does the Hindenburg ring any bells? Let me show you the new Stark Industries business plan! Look, that's a weapons company that doesn't make weapons!"
379,Tony Stark,Pepper. How big are your hands?
380,Pepper Potts,What?
381,Tony Stark,How big are your hands?
382,Pepper Potts,I don't understand why...
383,Tony Stark,"Get down here. I need you.  Oh, wow. They are small. Very petite, indeed. I just uh.. need your help for a sec."
384,Pepper Potts,"Oh, my God, is that the thing that's keeping you alive?"
385,Tony Stark,"It was. It is now an antique. This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future. I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit, and I just ran into a little speed bump."
386,Pepper Potts,"Speed bump, what does that mean?"
387,Tony Stark,It's nothing. It's just a little snag. There's an exposed wire under this device. And it's contacting the socket wall and causing a little bit of a short. It's fine.
388,Pepper Potts,What do you want me to do?
389,Tony Stark,Put that on the table over there. That is irrelevant.
390,Pepper Potts,"Oh, my God!"
391,Tony Stark,"I want you to reach in, and you're just gonna gently lift the wire out."
392,Pepper Potts,Is it safe?
393,Tony Stark,"Yeah, it should be fine. It's like Operation. You just don't let it touch the socket wall or it goes ""beep."""
394,Pepper Potts,"What do you mean, ""Operation""?"
395,Tony Stark,"It's just a game, never mind. Just gently lift the wire."
396,Pepper Potts,Okay.
397,Tony Stark,Okay? Great.
398,Pepper Potts,"You know, I don't think that I'm qualified to do this."
399,Tony Stark,"No, you're fine. You're the most capable, qualified, trustworthy person I've ever met. You're gonna do great. Is it too much of a problem to ask? 'Cause I'm..."
400,Pepper Potts,"Okay, okay."
401,Tony Stark,I really need your help here.
402,Pepper Potts,"Okay.  Oh, there's pus!"
403,Tony Stark,"It's not pus. It's an inorganic plasmic discharge from the device, not from my body."
404,Pepper Potts,It smells!
405,Tony Stark,"Yeah, it does. The copper wire. The copper wire, you got it?"
406,Pepper Potts,"Okay, I got it! I got it!"
407,Tony Stark,"Okay, you got it? Now, don't let it touch  the sides when you're coming out!"
408,Pepper Potts,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
409,Tony Stark,"That's what I was trying to tell you before. Okay, now make sure that when you pull it out, that you don't...  There's a magnet at the end of it! That was it. You just pulled it out."
410,Pepper Potts,"Oh, God!"
411,Tony Stark,"Okay, I was not expecting..."
412,Pepper Potts,"Okay, what do I do?"
413,Tony Stark,Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in!
414,Pepper Potts,What's wrong?
415,Tony Stark,"Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest--"
416,Pepper Potts,What? You said it was safe!
417,Tony Stark,'cause you yanked it out like a trout... We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this. You gotta switch it out really quick.
418,Pepper Potts,Okay. Okay. Tony?
419,Tony Stark,What?
420,Pepper Potts,It's going to be okay. Okay?
421,Tony Stark,Is it?
422,Pepper Potts,It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna make this okay.
423,Tony Stark,"Let's hope. Okay, you're gonna attach that to the base plate. Make s-sure you...  Was that so hard? That was fun, right? Here, I got it. I got it. Here. Nice."
424,Pepper Potts,Are you okay?
425,Tony Stark,"Yeah, I feel great. You okay?"
426,Pepper Potts,"Don't ever, ever, ever, ever ask me to do anything like that ever again."
427,Tony Stark,I don't have anyone but you. Anyway...
428,Pepper Potts,What do you want me to do with this?
429,Tony Stark,That? Destroy it. Incinerate it.
430,Pepper Potts,You don't want to keep it?
431,Tony Stark,"Pepper, I've been called many things. ""Nostalgic"" is not one of them."
432,Pepper Potts,"Will that be all, Mr. Stark?"
433,Tony Stark,"That will be all, Miss Potts.  Hey, Butterfingers, come here. What's all this stuff doing on top of my desk? That's my phone, that's a picture of me and my dad. Right there. In the garbage. All that stuff."
434,James Rhodes,"The future of air combat. Is it manned or unmanned? I'll tell you, in my experience, no unmanned aerial vehicle will ever trump a pilot's instinct, his insight, that ability to look into a situation beyond the obvious and discern its outcome, or a pilot's judgment."
435,Tony Stark,Colonel? Why not a pilot without the plane?
436,James Rhodes,Look who fell out of the sky. Mr. Tony Stark.
437,Man,"Hello, sir."
438,Tony Stark,"Speaking of manned or unmanned, you gotta get him to tell you about the time he guessed wrong at spring break. Just remember that, spring break, 1987. That lovely lady you woke up with."
439,James Rhodes,Don't do that!
440,Tony Stark,What was his name?
441,James Rhodes,Don't do that.
442,Tony Stark,Was it Ivan?
443,James Rhodes,Don't do that. They'll believe it.
444,Tony Stark,Okay.
445,James Rhodes,Don't do that.
446,Tony Stark,Okay.
447,James Rhodes,Don't do that.
448,Tony Stark,Pleasure meeting you.
449,James Rhodes,"Give us a couple minutes, you guys.  I'm surprised."
450,Tony Stark,Why?
451,James Rhodes,"I swear, I didn't expect to see you walking around so soon."
452,Tony Stark,I'm doing a little better than walking.
453,James Rhodes,Really?
454,Tony Stark,"Yeah. Rhodey, I'm working on something big. I came to talk to you. I want you to be a part of it."
455,James Rhodes,"You're about to make a whole lot of people around here real happy, 'cause that little stunt at the press conference, that was a doozy."
456,Tony Stark,This is not for the military. I'm not... It's different.
457,James Rhodes,What? You're a humanitarian now or something?
458,Tony Stark,I need you to listen to me.
459,James Rhodes,No. What you need is time to get your mind right. I'm serious.
460,Tony Stark,Okay.
461,James Rhodes,"It's nice seeing you, Tony."
462,Tony Stark,Thanks.
463,Tony Stark,"JARVIS, you up?"
464,JARVIS,"For you, sir, always."
465,Tony Stark,"I'd like to open a new project file, index as Mark Two."
466,JARVIS,Shall I store this on the Stark Industries Central Database?
467,Tony Stark,"Actually, I don't know who to trust right now. Till further notice, why don't we just keep everything on my private server?"
468,JARVIS,"Working on a secret project, are we, sir?"
469,Tony Stark,"I don't want this winding up in the wrong hands. Maybe in mine, it can actually do some good."
470,Tony Stark,"Next. Up. Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here. You got me? Stay put. Nice. You're of no benefit at all. Move down to the toe. I got this. Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way? Up. Screw it. Don't even move. You are a tragedy."
471,Tony Stark,"Okay, let's do this right. Start mark, half a meter, and back and center. Dummy, look alive. You're on standby for fire safety. You, roll it. Okay. Activate hand controls. We're gonna start off nice and easy. We're gonna see if 10% thrust capacity achieves lift. And three, two, one."
472,Tony Stark,"Up two. All right, set that."
473,Pepper Potts,I've been buzzing you. Did you hear the intercom?
474,Tony Stark,"Yeah, everything's... What?"
475,Pepper Potts,Obadiah's upstairs.
476,Tony Stark,Great!
477,Pepper Potts,What would you like me to tell him?
478,Tony Stark,Great. I'll be right up.
479,Pepper Potts,Okay. I thought you said you were done making weapons.
480,Tony Stark,"It is. This is a flight stabilizer. It's completely harmless.  How'd it go? It went that bad, huh?"
481,Obadiah Stane,Just because I brought pizza back from New York doesn't mean it went bad.
482,Tony Stark,"Sure doesn't. Oh, boy."
483,Obadiah Stane,It would have gone better if you were there.
484,Tony Stark,"Uh-huh. You told me to lay low. That's what I've been doing. I lay low, and you take care of all..."
485,Obadiah Stane,"Hey, come on. In public. The press.  This was a board of directors meeting."
486,Tony Stark,This was a board of directors meeting?
487,Obadiah Stane,The board is claiming you have post-traumatic stress. They're filing an injunction.
488,Tony Stark,A what?
489,Obadiah Stane,They want to lock you out.
490,Tony Stark,"Why, 'cause the stocks dipped 40 points? We knew that was gonna happen."
491,Pepper Potts,Fifty-six and a half.
492,Tony Stark,It doesn't matter. We own the controlling interest in the company.
493,Obadiah Stane,"Tony, the board has rights, too. They're making the case that you and your new direction isn't in the company's best interest."
494,Tony Stark,"I'm being responsible! That's a new direction for me, for the company. I mean, me on the company's behalf being responsible for the way that... This is great."
495,Obadiah Stane,"Oh, come on. Tony. Tony."
496,Tony Stark,I'll be in the shop.
497,Obadiah Stane,"Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen. I'm trying to turn this thing around, but you gotta give me something. Something to pitch them. Let me have the engineers analyze that. You know, draw up some specs."
498,Tony Stark,"No. No, absolutely not."
499,Obadiah Stane,It'll give me a bone to throw the boys in New York!
500,Tony Stark,"This one stays with me. That's it, Obie. Forget it."
501,Obadiah Stane,"All right, well, this stays with me, then.  Go on, here, you can have a piece. Take two."
502,Tony Stark,Thank you.
503,Obadiah Stane,You mind if I come down there and see what you're doing?
504,Tony Stark,"Good night, Obie."
505,Tony Stark,"No! Uh-uh! Uh-uh! Yeah, I can fly."
506,Tony Stark,"JARVIS, are you there?"
507,JARVIS,"At your service, sir."
508,Tony Stark,Engage heads-up display.
509,JARVIS,Check.
510,Tony Stark,Import all preferences from home interface.
511,JARVIS,"Will do, sir."
512,Tony Stark,"All right, what do you say?"
513,JARVIS,"I have indeed been uploaded, sir. We're online and ready."
514,Tony Stark,Can we start the virtual walk-around?
515,JARVIS,Importing preferences and calibrating virtual environment.
516,Tony Stark,Do a check on control surfaces
517,JARVIS,As you wish.  Test complete. Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics.
518,Tony Stark,"Uh, yeah. Tell you what. Do a weather and ATC check. Start listening in on ground control."
519,JARVIS,"Sir, there are still terabytes of calculations needed before an actual flight is..."
520,Tony Stark,"JARVIS! Sometimes you got to run before you can walk. Ready? In three, two, one.  Handles like a dream. All right, let's see what this thing can do. What's SR-71's record?"
521,JARVIS,"The altitude record for fixed wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir."
522,Tony Stark,Records are made to be broken! Come on!
523,JARVIS,"Sir, there is a potentially fatal buildup of ice occurring."
524,Tony Stark,"Keep going! Higher!  We iced up, JARVIS! Deploy flaps! JARVIS! Come on, we got to break the ice!"
525,Tony Stark,Kill power.
526,JARVIS,"A very astute observation, sir."
527,TV Reporter,"Tonight's red-hot red carpet is right here at the Disney Concert Hall, where Tony Stark's third annual benefitfor the Firefighter's Family Fund has become the place to be for L.A.'s high society."
528,Tony Stark,"JARVIS, we get an invite for that?"
529,JARVIS,"I have no record of an invitation, sir."
530,TV Reporter,"... hasn't been seen in public since his bizarre and highly controversial press conference. Some claim he's suffering from post traumatic stress and has been bedridden for weeks. Whatever the case may be, no one expects an appearance from him tonight."
531,JARVIS,The render is complete.
532,Tony Stark,"A little ostentatious, don't you think?"
533,JARVIS,What was I thinking? You're usually so discreet.
534,Tony Stark,Tell you what. Throw a little hot-rod red in there.
535,JARVIS,"Yes, that should help you keep a low profile. The render is complete."
536,Tony Stark,"Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it."
537,JARVIS,Commencing automated assembly. Estimated completion time is five hours.
538,Tony Stark,"Don't wait up for me, honey."
539,Random Woman,"Hey, Tony, remember me?"
540,Tony Stark,"Sure don't. You look great, Hef."
541,Obadiah Stane,We're going to have a great quarter.
542,Tony Stark,What's the world coming to when a guy's got to crash his own party?
543,Obadiah Stane,"Look at you. Hey, what a surprise."
544,Tony Stark,I'll see you inside.
545,Obadiah Stane,"Hey. Listen, take it slow, all right? I think I got the board right where we want them"
546,Tony Stark,You got it. Just cabin fever. I'll just be a minute. Give me a Scotch. I'm starving.
547,Agent Coulson,Mr. Stark?
548,Tony Stark,Yeah?
549,Agent Coulson,Agent Coulson.
550,Tony Stark,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The guy from the.."
551,Agent Coulson,"Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division."
552,Tony Stark,"God, you need a new name for that."
553,Agent Coulson,"Yeah, I hear that a lot. Listen, I know this must be a trying time for you, but we need to debrief you. There's still a lot of unanswered questions, and time can be a factor with these things."
554,Tony Stark,Let's just put something on the books.
555,Agent Coulson,How about the 24th at 7:00 p.m. at Stark Industries?
556,Tony Stark,"Tell you what. You got it. You're absolutely right. Well, I'm going to go to my assistant, and we'll make a date. You look fantastic! I didn't recognize you."
557,Pepper Potts,What are you doing here?
558,Tony Stark,Just avoiding government agents.
559,Pepper Potts,Are you by yourself?
560,Tony Stark,Yes. Where'd you get that dress?
561,Pepper Potts,"Oh, it was a birthday present."
562,Tony Stark,That's great.
563,Pepper Potts,"From you, actually."
564,Tony Stark,"Well, I got great taste."
565,Pepper Potts,Yes.
566,Tony Stark,You want to dance?
567,Pepper Potts,"Oh, no."
568,Tony Stark,"All right, come on."
569,Pepper Potts,Thank you. No.
570,Tony Stark,Am I making you uncomfortable?
571,Pepper Potts,No. No. I always forget to wear deodorant and dance with my boss in front of everyone that I work with in a dress with no back.
572,Tony Stark,You look great and you smell great.
573,Pepper Potts,"Oh, God."
574,Tony Stark,But I could fire you if that would take the edge off.
575,Pepper Potts,I actually don't think that you could tie your shoes without me.
576,Tony Stark,I'd make it a week. Sure.
577,Pepper Potts,Really? What's your Social Security number?
578,Tony Stark,Five.
579,Pepper Potts,Five?
580,Tony Stark,Right.
581,Pepper Potts,Right. You're missing just a couple of digits there.
582,Tony Stark,"The other eight? So, I got you for the other eight. How about a little air?"
583,Pepper Potts,"Yes, I need some air. That was totally weird."
584,Tony Stark,Totally harmless.
585,Pepper Potts,"It was totally not harmless, by the way."
586,Tony Stark,We're dancing. No one's even watching.
587,Pepper Potts,"No, it was not just a dance. You don't understand because you're you. And everybody knows exactly who you are and how you are with girls and all of that, which is completely fine. But, you know, then me, you're my boss, and I'm dancing with you."
588,Tony Stark,I don't think it was taken that way.
589,Pepper Potts,Because it makes me look like the one who's trying to...
590,Tony Stark,I just think you're overstating it.
591,Pepper Potts,"You know, and we're here, and then I'm wearing this ridiculous dress, and then we were dancing like that and... I would like a drink, please."
592,Tony Stark,"Got it, okay."
593,Pepper Potts,"I would like a vodka martini, please."
594,Tony Stark,Okay.
595,Pepper Potts,"Very dry with olives, a lot of olives. Like, at least three olives."
596,Tony Stark,"Two vodka martinis, extra dry, extra olives, extra fast. Make one of them dirty, will you?"
597,Christine Everhart,Wow. Tony Stark.
598,Tony Stark,"Oh, hey."
599,Christine Everhart,Fancy seeing you here.
600,Tony Stark,Carrie.
601,Christine Everhart,Christine.
602,Tony Stark,Carrie.
603,Christine Everhart,Christine.
604,Tony Stark,That's right.
605,Christine Everhart,You have a lot of nerve showing up here tonight. Can I at least get a reaction from you?
606,Tony Stark,Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.
607,Christine Everhart,'Cause I was referring to your company's involvement in this latest atrocity
608,Tony Stark,Yeah. They just put my name on the invitation. I don't know what to tell you.
609,Christine Everhart,"I actually almost bought it, hook, line and sinker."
610,Tony Stark,"I was out of town for a couple months, in case you didn't hear."
611,Christine Everhart,Is this what you call accountability? It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?
612,Tony Stark,When were these taken?
613,Christine Everhart,Yesterday.
614,Tony Stark,I didn't approve any shipment.
615,Christine Everhart,"Well, your company did."
616,Tony Stark,"Well, I'm not my company."
617,Obadiah Stane,"Please, do you mind?"
618,Tony Stark,Have you seen these pictures? What's going on in Gulmira?
619,Obadiah Stane,"Tony, Tony. You can't afford to be this naive."
620,Tony Stark,"You know what? I was naive before, when they said, ""Here's the line. We don't cross it. This is how we do business."" If we're double-dealing under the table... Are we?"
621,Reporter,"Tony, your picture, please!"
622,Obadiah Stane,Let's take a picture. Come on. Picture time! Tony. Who do you think locked you out? I was the one who filed the injunction against you. It was the only way I could protect you.
623,Obadiah Stane,No. No.
624,TV Reporter,"The 15-mile hike to the outskirts of Gulmira can only be described as a descent into hell, into a modern-day Heart of Darkness. Simple farmers and herders from peaceful villages have been driven from their homes, displaced from their lands by warlords emboldened by a new-found power. Villagers have been forced to take shelter in whatever crude dwellings they can find in the ruins of other villages, or here in the remnants of an old Soviet smelting plant. Recent violence has been attributed to a group of foreign fighters referred to by locals as the Ten Rings. As you can see, these men are heavily armed and on a mission. A mission that could prove fatal to anyone who stands in their way. With no political will or international pressure, there's very little hope for these refugees. Around me, a woman begging for news on her husband, who was kidnapped by insurgents, either forced to join their militia. Desperate refugees clutch yellowed photographs, holding them up to anyone who will stop. A child's simple question, ""Where are my mother and father?"" There's very little hope for these refugees, refugees who can only wonder who, if anyone, will help."
625,Tony Stark,He's all yours.
626,Captain,What the hell was that? Were we cleared to go in there?
627,CAOC Analyst #1,"No sir, they were using human shields. We never got the green light"
628,Major Allen,Put me through to State. They're going to be all over this.
629,CAOC Analyst,Get those monitors up!
630,CAOC Analyst,We got a bogey!
631,CAOC Analyst,Wasn't Air Force!
632,Major Allen,We got the CIA on the line?
633,Captain,I've got Langley on the line. They want to know if it's us.
634,CAOC Analyst #1,"No, it definitely is not us, sir!"
635,CAOC Analyst #2,It wasn't Navy.
636,CAOC Analyst #3,Wasn't Marines.
637,Major Allen,I need answers! Can I please get eyes on target?
638,CAOC Analyst,"Negative, negative. Cannot identify."
639,Major Allen,Get me Colonel Rhodes from weapons development down here now!
640,Major Allen,We ran an ID check and cross-referenced with all known databases. We have nothing.
641,James Rhodes,Any high-altitude surveillance in the region?
642,Captain,We got an AWAC and a Global Hawk in the area.
643,James Rhodes,"So, this thing just appeared out of nowhere? How come it didn't show up on the radar?"
644,CAOC Analyst #1,"Got a minimal radar cross-section, sir."
645,James Rhodes,Is it stealth?
646,CAOC Analyst #1,"No, sir, it's tiny. We think it's an unmanned aerial vehicle."
647,Major Allen,"Colonel, what are we dealing with here?"
648,James Rhodes,Let me make a call.
649,Major Allen,"Sergeant, clear a hole."
650,Tony Stark,Hello?
651,James Rhodes,Tony?
652,Tony Stark,Who's this?
653,James Rhodes,It's Rhodes.
654,Tony Stark,"Sorry, hello?"
655,James Rhodes,I said it's Rhodes.
656,Tony Stark,"Speak up, please."
657,James Rhodes,What in the hell is that noise?
658,Tony Stark,"Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down."
659,James Rhodes,"Yeah, well, I need your help right now."
660,Tony Stark,"It's funny how that works, huh?"
661,James Rhodes,"Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a weapons depot that was just blown up a few clicks from where you were being held captive."
662,Tony Stark,"Well, that's a hot spot. Sounds like someone stepped in and did your job for you, huh?"
663,James Rhodes,"Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?"
664,Tony Stark,"I'm not, I was just jogging in the canyon."
665,James Rhodes,I thought you were driving.
666,Tony Stark,"Right, I was driving to the canyon, where I'm going to jog."
667,James Rhodes,You sure you don't have any tech in that area I should know about?
668,Tony Stark,Nope!
669,CAOC Analyst,Bogey spotted!
670,CAOC Analyst,"Whiplash, come in hot."
671,James Rhodes,"Okay, good, 'cause I'm staring at one right now, and it's about to be blown to kingdom come."
672,Tony Stark,That's my exit.
673,Pilot #1,"Ballroom, this is Whiplash One. I've got the bogey in my sights."
674,James Rhodes,"Whiplash One, what is it?"
675,Pilot #1,I've got no idea.
676,Major Allen,You have radio contact?
677,Pilot #1,"Non responsive, sir."
678,Major Allen,Then you are clear to engage.
679,Tony Stark,Hit it.
680,Pilot #1,That bogey just went supersonic. I got a lock!
681,JARVIS,Inbound missile.
682,Tony Stark,Flares!
683,Pilot #1,Wait a second. Bogey deployed flares!
684,Tony Stark,Deploy flaps!
685,Pilot #2,Holy!
686,CAOC Analyst,"That thing just jumped off the radar, sir."
687,CAOC Analyst #2,The sat visual has been lost.
688,Pilot #1,No way that's a UAV.
689,Major Allen,What is it?
690,Pilot #2,I can't see anything.
691,Pilot #1,"Whatever it was, it just bought the farm. I think bogey's been handled, sir."
692,James Rhodes,Hello?
693,Tony Stark,"Hi, Rhodey, it's me."
694,James Rhodes,It's who?
695,Tony Stark,"I'm sorry, it is me. You asked. What you were asking about is me."
696,James Rhodes,"No, see, this isn't a game. You do not send civilian equipment into my active war zone. You understand that?"
697,Tony Stark,This is not a piece of equipment. I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!
698,Major Allen,"Rhodey, you got anything for me?"
699,Major Allen,Mark your position and return to base.
700,Pilot #1,"Roger that, Ballroom."
701,Pilot #1,On your belly! It looks like a man! Shake him off! Roll! Roll! I'm hit! I'm hit!
702,Pilot #2,Punch out! Punch out! Whiplash One down.
703,Pilot #2,"Negative! No chute, no chute!"
704,Pilot #1,My chute's jammed!
705,Pilot #2,"Sir, I've got a visual on the bogey."
706,Major Allen,"Whiplash Two, reengage. If you get a clear shot, you take it."
707,James Rhodes,"Major, we don't even know what we're shooting at. Call off the Raptors."
708,Major Allen,"That thing just took out an F-22 inside a legal no fly zone! Whiplash Two, if you have a clear shot, take it!"
709,JARVIS,You've been reengaged. Execute evasive maneuver.
710,Tony Stark1,Keep going!
711,Pilot #2,Good chute! Good chute!
712,James Rhodes,"Tony, you still there?"
713,Tony Stark,"Hey, thanks."
714,James Rhodes,"Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch. You owe me a plane. You know that, right?"
715,Tony Stark,"Yeah, well, technically, he hit me. Now are you going to come by and see what I'm working on?"
716,James Rhodes,"No, no, no, no, no, no, the less I know, the better. Now, what am I supposed to tell the press?"
717,Tony Stark,Training exercise. Isn't that the usual BS?
718,James Rhodes,"It's not that simple. An unfortunate training exercise involving an F-22 Raptor occurred yesterday. I am pleased to report that the pilot was not injured. As for the unexpected turn of events on the ground in Gulmira, it is still unclear who or what intervened, but I can assure you that the United States government was not involved."
719,Tony Stark,Hey!
720,JARVIS,"It is a tight fit, sir. Sir, the more you struggle, the more this is going to hurt."
721,Tony Stark,"Be gentle. This is my first time. I designed this to come off, so... Hey. I really should be able to..."
722,JARVIS,"Please, try not to move, sir."
723,Pepper Potts,What's going on here?
724,Tony Stark,Let's face it. This is not the worst thing you've caught me doing.
725,Pepper Potts,Are those bullet holes?
726,Obadiah Stane,"If you'd killed him when you were supposed to, you'd still have a face."
727,Raza,You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.
728,Tony Stark,"Hey. You busy? You mind if I send you on an errand? I need you to go to my office. You're going to hack into the mainframe and you're going to retrieve all the recent shipping manifests. This is a lock chip. This'll get you in. It's probably under Executive Files. If not, they put it on a ghost drive, in which case you need to look for the lowest numeric heading."
729,Pepper Potts,And what do you plan to do with this information if I bring it back here?
730,Tony Stark,"Same drill. They've been dealing under the table, and I'm going to stop them. I'm going to find my weapons and destroy them."
731,Pepper Potts,"Tony, you know that I would help you with anything, but I cannot help you if you're going to start all of this again."
732,Tony Stark,There is nothing except this. There's no art opening. There is no benefit. There is nothing to sign. There is the next mission and nothing else.
733,Pepper Potts,"Is that so? Well, then, I quit."
734,Tony Stark,"You stood by my side all these years while I reaped the benefits of destruction. And now that I'm trying to protect the people that I put in harm's way, you're going to walk out?"
735,Pepper Potts,"You're going to kill yourself, Tony. I'm not going to be a part of it."
736,Tony Stark,"I shouldn't be alive, unless it was for a reason. I'm not crazy, Pepper. I just finally know what I have to do. And I know in my heart that it's right."
737,Pepper Potts,"You're all I have, too, you know. Sector 16? What are you up to, Obadiah?"
738,Video Voice Over,"You did not tell us that the target you paid us to kill was the great Tony Stark. As you can see, Obadiah Stane..."
739,Pepper Potts,"Oh, my God."
740,Video Voice Over,... your deception and lies will cost you dearly. The price to kill Tony Stark has just gone up.
741,Obadiah Stane,"So, what are we going to do about this? I know what you're going through, Pepper. Tony. He always gets the good stuff, doesn't he? I was so happy when he came home. It was like we got him back from the dead. Now I realize, well, Tony never really did come home, did he? He left a part of himself in that cave. Breaks my heart."
742,Pepper Potts,"Well, he's a complicated person."
743,Obadiah Stane,He's been through a lot. I think he'll be all right. You are a very rare woman. Tony doesn't know how lucky he is.
744,Pepper Potts,Thank you. Thanks. I'd better get back there.
745,Obadiah Stane,Is that today's paper?
746,Pepper Potts,Yes.
747,Obadiah Stane,Do you mind?
748,Pepper Potts,Not at all.
749,Obadiah Stane,Puzzle.
750,Agent Coulson,Ms. Potts? We had an appointment. Did you forget about our appointment?
751,Pepper Potts,"Nope, right now. Come with me."
752,Agent Coulson,Right now?
753,Pepper Potts,"We're going to have it right now. Yeah, walk with me."
754,Agent Coulson,Okay.
755,Pepper Potts,I'm going to give you the meeting of your life. Your office.
756,Obadiah Stane,Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave! With a box of scraps!
757,Pepper Potts,"Tony? Tony, are you there? Hello?"
758,Obadiah Stane,"Breathe. Easy, easy. You remember this one, right? It's a shame the government didn't approve it. There's so many applications for causing short-term paralysis. Tony. When I ordered the hit on you, I worried that I was killing the golden goose. But, you see, it was just fate that you survived that. You had one last golden egg to give. Do you really think that just because you have an idea, it belongs to you? Your father, he helped give us the atomic bomb. Now, what kind of world would it be today if he was as selfish as you? Oh, it's beautiful. Tony, this is your Ninth Symphony. What a masterpiece. Look at that. This is your legacy. A new generation of weapons with this at its heart. Weapons that will help steer the world back on course, put the balance of power in our hands. The right hands. I wish you could've seen my prototype. It's not as... Well, not as conservative as yours. Too bad you had to involve Pepper in this. I would have preferred that she lived."
759,James Rhodes,"What do you mean, he paid to have Tony killed? Pepper, slow down. Why would Obadiah... Okay, where's Tony now?"
760,Pepper Potts,"I don't know. He's not answering his phone. Please go over there and make sure everything's okay. Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut."
761,Tony Stark,Good boy.
762,James Rhodes,Tony? Tony? Tony? Tony? Tony! Tony! You okay?
763,Tony Stark,Where's Pepper?
764,James Rhodes,She's fine. She's with five agents. They're about to arrest Obadiah.
765,Tony Stark,That's not going to be enough.
766,Pepper Potts,"Section 16. Section 16. There it is. My key's not working. It's not opening the door. Oh, wow! What's that? It's, like, a little device. It's, like, a thing that's going to pick the lock?"
767,Agent Coulson,You might want to take a few steps back.
768,James Rhodes,That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.
769,Tony Stark,"Not bad, huh? Let's do it."
770,James Rhodes,You need me to do anything else?
771,Tony Stark,Keep the skies clear.
772,James Rhodes,"Damn! Next time, baby."
773,Tony Stark,How do you think the Mark One chest piece is going to hold up?
774,JARVIS,"The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir. That chest piece was never designed for sustained flight."
775,Tony Stark,Keep me posted. Pepper!
776,Pepper Potts,"Tony! Tony, are you okay?"
777,Tony Stark,I'm fine. How are...
778,Pepper Potts,"Obadiah, he's gone insane!"
779,Tony Stark,"I know. Listen, you'd better get out of there."
780,Pepper Potts,He built a suit.
781,Tony Stark,Get out of there right now!
782,Obadiah Stane,"Collateral damage, Tony."
783,JARVIS,"Sir, it appears that his suit can fly."
784,Tony Stark,Duly noted. Take me to maximum altitude.
785,JARVIS,"With only 15% power, the odds of reaching that--"
786,Tony Stark,I know the math! Do it!
787,James Rhodes,"Not necessary, people. Just a training exercise."
788,JARVIS,"Thirteen percent power, sir."
789,Tony Stark,Climb!
790,JARVIS,Eleven percent.
791,Tony Stark,Keep going!
792,JARVIS,Seven percent power.
793,Tony Stark,Just leave it on the screen!
794,Obadiah Stane,"You had a great idea, Tony, but my suit is more advanced in every way!"
795,Tony Stark,How'd you solve the icing problem?
796,Obadiah Stane,Icing problem?
797,Tony Stark,Might want to look into it.
798,JARVIS,Two percent. We are now running on emergency backup power.
799,Tony Stark,Potts!
800,Pepper Potts,"Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?"
801,Tony Stark,I'm almost out of power. I've got to get out of this thing. I'll be right there.
802,Tony Stark,Potts?
803,Pepper Potts,Tony!
804,Tony Stark,This isn't working. We're going to have to overload the reactor and blast the roof.
805,Pepper Potts,"Well, how are you going to do that?"
806,Tony Stark,"You're going to do it. Go to the central console, open up all the circuits. When I get clear of the roof, I'll let you know. You're going to hit the master bypass button. It's going to fry everything up here."
807,Pepper Potts,Okay. I'm going in now.
808,Tony Stark,Make sure you wait till I clear the roof. I'll buy you some time. This looks important!
809,Obadiah Stane,"I never had a taste for this sort of thing, but I must admit, I'm deeply enjoying the suit! You finally outdid yourself, Tony! You'd have made your father proud!"
810,Pepper Potts,"It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof! Tony!"
811,Obadiah Stane,"How ironic, Tony! Trying to rid the world of weapons, you gave it its best one ever!"
812,Tony Stark,Pepper!
813,Obadiah Stane,And now I'm going to kill you with it! You ripped out my targeting system!
814,Tony Stark,Time to hit the button!
815,Pepper Potts,You told me not to!
816,Obadiah Stane,"Hold still, you little prick!"
817,Tony Stark,Just do it!
818,Pepper Potts,You'll die!
819,Tony Stark,Push it!
820,Pepper Potts,Tony!
821,Tony Stark,"""Iron Man."" That's kind of catchy.It's got a nice ring to it. I mean, it's not technically accurate. The suit's a gold-titanium alloy, but it's kind of evocative, the imagery, anyway."
822,Agent Coulson,Here's your alibi.
823,Agent Coulson,You were on your yacht.
824,Agent Coulson,"We have port papers that put you in Avalon all night, and sworn statements from 50 of your guests."
825,Tony Stark,"See, I was thinking maybe we should say it was just Pepper and me alone on the island."
826,Agent Coulson,That's what happened.
827,Agent Coulson,"Just read it, word for word."
828,Tony Stark,There's nothing about Stane here.
829,Agent Coulson,That's being handled. He's on vacation. Small aircraft have such a poor safety record.
830,Tony Stark,"But what about the whole cover story that it's a bodyguard? He's my... I mean, is that... That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?"
831,Agent Coulson,"This isn't my first rodeo, Mr. Stark. Just stick to the official statement, and soon, this will all be behind you."
832,Pepper Potts,Agent Coulson? I just wanted to say thank you very much for all of your help.
833,Agent Coulson,That's what we do. You'll be hearing from us.
834,Pepper Potts,From the Strategic Homeland...
835,Agent Coulson,Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.
836,Pepper Potts,Right. Let's get this show on the road.
837,Tony Stark,"You know, it's actually not that bad. Even I don't think I'm Iron Man."
838,Pepper Potts,You're not Iron Man.
839,Tony Stark,Am so.
840,Pepper Potts,You're not.
841,Tony Stark,"All right, suit yourself. You know, if I were Iron Man, I'd have this girlfriend who knew my true identity. She'd be a wreck, 'cause she'd always be worrying that I was going to die, yet so proud of the man I'd become. She'd be wildly conflicted, which would only make her more crazy about me. Tell me you never think about that night."
842,Pepper Potts,What night?
843,Tony Stark,You know.
844,Pepper Potts,"Are you talking about the night that we danced and went up on the roof, and then you went downstairs to get me a drink, and you left me there, by myself? Is that the night you're talking about? Thought so. Will that be all, Mr. Stark?"
845,Tony Stark,"Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts."
846,James Rhodes,"And now, Mr. Stark has prepared a statement. He will not be taking any questions."
847,Tony Stark,Thank you. Been a while since I was in front of you. I figure I'll stick to the cards this time. There's been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop...
848,Christine Everhart,"I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared, despite the fact that you..."
849,Tony Stark,"I know that it's confusing. It is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I'm a superhero."
850,Christine Everhart,I never said you were a superhero.
851,Tony Stark,"Didn't? Well, good, because that would be outlandish and fantastic. I'm just not the hero type. Clearly. With this laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I've made, largely public."
852,James Rhodes,"Just stick to the cards, man."
853,Tony Stark,"Yeah, okay. Yeah. The truth is... I am Iron Man."
854,Tony Stark,Jarvis!
855,JARVIS,
856,Nick Fury,"""I am Iron Man."" You think you're the only superhero in the world? Mr. Stark, you've become part of a bigger universe. You just don't know it yet."
857,Tony Stark,Who the hell are you?
858,Nick Fury,"Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D."
859,Tony Stark,Ah.
860,Nick Fury,I'm here to talk to you about the Avengers Initiative.
0,Tony,Been a while since I was up here in front of you. Maybe I’ll do us all a favour and just stick to the cards. There’s been some speculation that I was somehow involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and on the rooftop…Christine Everhart
1,Man,"270 at 30 knots. Holding steady at 15000 feet. You are clear for exfiltration over the drop zonePretty much everyone in the crowd: Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!Tony: It’s good to be back.

2,Reporter,"We are coming to you live from the kickoff at the Stark Expo, where Tony Stark has just walked offstage. Don’t worry if you can’t make it down here tonight because this Expo goes on all year long. And I’m gonna be here checking out all the attractions and the pavilions and inventions from all around the world."
3,Happy Hogan,Make sure you join me…
4,Tony,"All right, it’s a zoo out there, watch out."
5,Happy,"Open up, let’s go."
6,Tony,"Hey, nice to see you. All right. Thank you. I remember you."
7,People,"Tony, Tony"
8,Tony,"Hey, hey."
9,Woman,Call me.
10,Happy,"Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on."
11,Tony,Hello. It would be a pleasure.
12,Happy,Okay
13,Tony,See you buddy
14,Happy,This is Larry.
15,Tony,"Hey, the oracle of Oracle. What a pleasure. Nice to see you."
16,Larry,Call me. Call me.
17,Happy,Larry King.
18,Tony,"Larry! Larry. Yes, my people, my people."
19,Happy,"Come on, Tony. There we go."
20,Tony,Very mellow.
21,Happy,That wasn’t so bad.
22,Tony,"No, it was perfect."
23,Happy,"Look what we got here, the new model."
24,Tony,"Hey, does she come with the car?"
25,Happy,I certainly hope so. Hi.
26,Tony,Hi. And you are?
27,Woman,Marshal.
28,Tony,Irish. I like it.
29,Marshal,Pleased to meet you Tony.
30,Tony,I’m on the wheel. Do you mind? Where you from?
31,Marshal,Bedford.
32,Tony,What are you doing here?
33,Marshal,Looking for you.
34,Tony,Yeah? You found me. What are you up to later?
35,Marshal,Serving subpoenas.
36,Tony,Yikes.
37,Happy,He doesn’t like to be handed things.
38,Tony,"Yeah, I have a peeve."
39,Marshal,I got it. You are hereby ordered to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee tomorrow morning at 9 am.
40,Tony,Can I see a badge?
41,Marshal,You wanna see the badge?
42,Happy,He likes the badge.
43,Marshal,You still like it?
44,Tony,Yep.  How far are we from D.C.?
45,Happy,D.C.? 250 miles.
46,Senator Stern,"Mr Stark, could we pick up now where we left off? Mr Stark. Please."
47,Tony,Yes dear?
48,Senator Stern,Can I have your attention?
49,Tony,Absolutely.
50,Stern,Do you or do you not possess a specialised weapon?
51,Tony,I do not.
52,Stern,You do not?
53,Tony,"I do not. Well, it depends on how you define the word weapon."
54,Stern,The Iron Man weapon.
55,Tony,My device does not fit that description.
56,Stern,Well… How would you describe it?
57,Tony,"I would describe it by defining it as what it is, Senator."
58,Stern,As?
59,Tony,It’s a high-tech prosthesis. That is… That is… That’s actually the most apt description I can make of it.
60,Stern,"It’s a weapon. It’s a weapon, Mr Stark."
61,Tony,"Please, if your priority was actually the well-being of the American citizen…"
62,Stern,My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon turned over to the people of the United States of America.
63,Tony,"Well, you can forget it. I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one. To turn over the Iron Man suit would be to turn over myself which is tantamount to indentured servitude or prostitution, depending or what state you’re in. You can’t have it."
64,Stern,"Look, I’m no expert…"
65,Tony,In prostitution? Of course not. You’re a senator. Come on.
66,Stern,"I’m no expert in weapons. We have somebody here who is an expert on weapons. I’d now like to call Justin Hammer, our current primary weapons contractor."
67,Tony,"Let the record reflect that I observed Mr Hammer entering the chamber, and I am wondering if and when any actual expert will also be in attendance."
68,Justin Hammer,"Absolutely. I’m no expert. I defer to you, Anthony. You’re the wonder boy. Senator, if I may. I may well not be an expert, but you know who was the expert? Your dad. Howard Stark. Really a father to us all, and to the military-industrial age. Let’s just be clear, he was no flower child. He was a lion. We all know why we’re here. In the last six months, Anthony Stark has created a sword with untold possibilities. And yet, he insists it’s a shield. He asks us to trust him as we cower behind it. I wish I were comforted, Anthony, I really do. I’d love to leave my door unlocked when I leave the house, but this ain’t Canada. You know, we live in a world of grave threats, threats that Mr Stark will not always be able to foresee. Thank you. God bless Iron Man. God bless America."
69,Stern,That is well said Mr Hammer. The committee would now like to invite Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to the chamber.
70,Tony,Rhodey? What?
71,Tony,"Hey, buddy. I didn’t expect to see you here."
72,Rhodey,"Look, it’s me, I’m here. Deal with it. Let’s move on."
73,Tony,I just…
74,Rhodey,Drop it.
75,Tony,"All right, I’ll drop it."
76,Stern,"I have before me a complete report on the Iron Man weapon, complied by Colonel Rhodes. And, Colonel, for the record, can you please read page 57, paragraph four?"
77,Rhodey,"You’re requesting that I read specific selections from my report, Senator?"
78,Stern,"Yes, sir."
79,Rhodey,It was my understanding that I was going to be testifying in a much more comprehensive and detailed manner.
80,Stern,I understand. A lot of things have changed today. So if you could just read…
81,Rhodey,You do understand that reading a single paragraph out of context does not reflect the summery of my final…
82,Stern,"Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you."
83,Rhodey,"Very well. “As he does not operate within any definable branch of government, Iron Man presents a potential threat to the security of both the nation and to her interests.” I did however, go on to summarise that the benefits of Iron Man far outweigh three liabilities and that it would be in our interest…"
84,Stern,That’s enough Colonel
85,Rhodey,…to fold Mr Stark…
86,Stern,That’s enough
87,Rhodey,"…into the existing chain of command, Senator."
88,Tony,"I’m not a joiner, but I’ll consider Secretary of Defence, if you ask nice."
89,Tony,We can amend the hours a little bit.
90,Stern,"I’d like to go on and show, if I may, the imagery that’s connected to your report."
91,Rhodey,I believe it is somewhat premature to reveal these images to the general public at this time.
92,Stern,"With all due respect, Colonel, I understand. And if you could just narrate those for us, we’d be very grateful. Let’s have the images."
93,Rhodey,"Intelligence suggests that the devices seen in these photos are, in fact, attempts at making manned copies of Mr Stark’s suit. This has been corroborated by our allies and local intelligence on the ground…"
94,Rhodey,"… indicating that these suits are quite possibly, at this moment, operational."
95,Tony,"Hold on a second buddy. Let me see something here.  Boy, I’m good. I commandeered your screens. I need them. Time for a little transparency. Now, let’s see what’s really going on."
96,Stern,What is he doing?
97,Tony,"If you will direct your attention to said screens, I believe that’s North Korea."
98,Stern,Can you turn that off? Take it off.
99,Tony,Iran.
100,Tony,No grave threat here. Is that Justin Hammer? How did Hammer get in the game?
101,Tony,"Justin, you’re on TV. Focus up."
102,TV Justin,"Okay, give me a left twist. Left’s good. Turn to the right. Oh, shit. Oh, shit."
103,Tony,"Wow. Yeah, I’d say most countries, five, ten years away. Hammer Industries, twenty."
104,Justin,I’d like to point out that that test pilot survived.
105,Stern,I think we’re done is the point that he’s making. I don’t think there’s any reason…
106,Tony,"The point is, you’re welcome, I guess"
107,Stern,For what?
108,Tony,Because I’m your nuclear deterrent. It’s working. We’re safe. America is secure. You want my property? You can’t have it. But I did you a big favour.
109,Tony,I’ve successfully privatised world peace.
110,Tony,What more do you want? For now! I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.
111,Stern,"you, buddy. We’re adjourned. We’re adjourned for today."
112,Tony,Okay.
113,Stern,You’ve been a delight.
114,Tony,My bond is with the people. And I will serve this great nation at the pleasure of myself. If there’s one thing I’ve proven it’s that you can count on me to pleasure myself.
115,Tony,"Wake up, Daddy’s home."
116,Jarvis,"Welcome home, sir. Congratulations on the opening ceremonies. They were such a success, as was your Senate hearing. And may I say how refreshing it is to finally see you in a video with your clothing on, sir."
117,Tony,You!
118,Tony,I swear to God I’ll dismantle you. I’ll soak your motherboard. I’ll turn you into a wine rack.
119,Tony,How many ounce a day of this gobbledegook am I supposed to drink?
120,Jarvis,"We are up to 80 ounces a day to counteract the symptoms, sir."
121,Tony,Check palladium levels.
122,Jarvis,"Blood toxicity, 24%. It appears that the continued use of the Iron Man suit is accelerating your condition. Another core has been depleted."
123,Tony,"God, they’re running out quick."
124,Jarvis,"I have run simulations on every known element, and none can serve as a viable replacement for the palladium core."
125,Jarvis,"You are running out of both time and options. Unfortunately, the device that’s keeping you alive is also killing you."
126,Jarvis,Miss Potts is approaching. I recommend that you inform her…
127,Tony,Mute.
128,Pepper,Is this a joke? What are you thinking?
129,Tony,What?
130,Pepper,What are you thinking?
131,Tony,"Hey, I’m thinking I’m busy. And you’re angry about something. Do you have the sniffles? I don’t want to get sick."
132,Pepper,Did you just donate…
133,Tony,Keep your business.
134,Pepper,…our entire modern art collection to the…
135,Tony,Boy Scouts of America.
136,Pepper,…Boy Scouts of America?
137,Tony,"Yes. It is a worthwhile organisation. I didn’t physically check the crates but, basically, yes. And it’s not “our” collection, it’s my collection. No offence."
138,Pepper,"No, you know what? I think I’m actually entitled to say “our” collection considering the time that I put in, over 10 years, curating that."
139,Tony,It was a tax write-off. I needed that.
140,Pepper,"You know, there’s only about 8,011 things that I really need to talk to you about."
141,Tony,"Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out. The Bridgeport’s already machining that part."
142,Pepper,The Expo is a gigantic waste of time.
143,Tony,I need you to wear a surgical mask until you’re feeling better. Is that okay?
144,Pepper,That’s rude.
145,Tony,There’s nothing more important to me than the Expo. It’s my primary point of concern. I don’t know why you’re…
146,Pepper,The Expo is your ego gone crazy.
147,Tony,Wow. Look at that. That’s modern art. That’s going up.
148,Pepper,You’ve got to be kidding.
149,Tony,I’m gonna put this up right now. This is vital.
150,Pepper,Stark is in complete disarray. You understand that?
151,Tony,No. Our stocks have never been higher.
152,Pepper,"Yes, from a managerial standpoint."
153,Tony,"You are… Well, if’s messy then let’s double back."
154,Pepper,Let me give you an example.
155,Tony,Let’s move onto another subject.
156,Pepper,"No, no, no, no. You are not taking down the Barnett Newman and hanging that up."
157,Tony,I’m not taking it down. I’m just replacing it with this.
158,Tony,Let’s see what I can get going on here.
159,Pepper,"Okay, fine. My point is, we have already awarded contracts to the wind farm people."
160,Tony,Yeah. Don’t say “wind farm.” I’m already feeling gassy.
161,Pepper,"And to the plastic plantation tree, which was your idea by the way. Those people are on payroll…"
162,Tony,Everything was my idea.
163,Pepper,…and you won’t make a decision.
164,Tony,I don’t care about the liberal agenda any more. It’s boring. Boring. I’m giving you a boring alert.  You do it.
165,Pepper,I do what?
166,Tony,Excellent idea. I just figured this out. You run the company.
167,Pepper,"Yeah, I’m trying to run the company."
168,Tony,"Pepper, I need you to run the company. Well, stop trying to do it and do it."
169,Pepper,You will not give me the information…
170,Tony,I’m not asking you to try…
171,Pepper,…in order to…
172,Tony,I’m asking you to physically do it. I need you to do it.
173,Pepper,I am trying to do it.
174,Tony,"Pepper, you’re not listening to me!"
175,Pepper,"No, you are not listening to me."
176,Tony,I’m trying to make you CEO. Why won’t you let me?
177,Pepper,Have you been drinking?
178,Tony,"Chlorophyll. I hereby irrevocably appoint you chairman and CEO of Stark Industries effective immediately. Yeah, done deal. Okay? I’ve actually given this a fair amount of thought, believe it or not.  Congratulations? Take it, just take it."
179,Pepper,I don’t know what to think.
180,Tony,"Don’t think, drink. There you go."
181,Pepper,The notary’s here! Can you please come sign the transfer paperwork?
182,Tony,I’m on happy time.  Sorry.
183,Happy,What the hell was that?
184,Tony,It’s called mixed martial arts. It’s been around for three weeks.
185,Happy,"It’s called dirty boxing, there’s nothing new about it"
186,Tony,"All right, put them up. Come on."
187,Pepper,I promise this is the only time I will ask you to sign over your company.
188,Notary,I need you to initial each box.
189,Happy,
190,Tony,"That’s it. I’m done. What’s your name, lady?"
191,Notary,Rushman. Natalie Rushman
192,Tony,Front and centre. Come into the church.
193,Pepper,No. You’re seriously not gonna ask…
194,Tony,"If it pleases the court, which it does."
195,Natalie,It’s no problem.
196,Pepper,I’m sorry. He’s very eccentric.
197,Tony,Can you give her a lesson?
198,Happy,No problem.
199,Tony,Pepper.
200,Pepper,What?
201,Tony,Who is she?
202,Pepper,She is from legal. And she is potentially a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit if you keep ogling her like that.
203,Tony,"I need a new assistant, boss."
204,Pepper,"Yes, and I’ve got three excellent potential candidates. They’re lined up and ready to meet you."
205,Tony,I don’t have time to meet. I need someone now. I feel like it’s her.
206,Pepper,"No, it’s not."
207,Happy,You ever boxed before?
208,Natalie,"I have, yes."
209,Happy,"What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot Camp? Crunch? Something like that?"
210,Tony,"How do I spell your name, Natalie?"
211,Natalie,R-U-S-H-M-A-N.
212,Pepper,"What, are you gonna google her now?"
213,Tony,"I thought I was ogling her.  Wow. Very, very impressive individual."
214,Pepper,"You’re so predictable, you know that?"
215,Tony,"She’s fluent in French, Italian, Russian, Latin. Who speaks Latin?"
216,Pepper,No one speaks Latin.
217,Tony,No one speaks Latin
218,Pepper,"It’s a dead language. You can read Latin or you can write Latin, but you can’t speak Latin."
219,Tony,Did you model in Tokyo? ‘Cause she modelled in Tokyo.
220,Pepper,Well…
221,Tony,I need her. She’s got everything that I need.
222,Happy,"Rule number one, never take your eyes off your opponent."
223,Pepper,"Oh, my God! Happy."
224,Tony,That’s what I’m talking about.
225,Happy,I just slipped.
226,Tony,You did?
227,Happy,Yeah.
228,Tony,Looks like a TKO to me.
229,Natalie,Just… I need your impression.
230,Tony,"You have a quiet reserve. I don’t know, you have an old soul."
231,Natalie,I meant your fingerprint.
232,Tony,Right.
233,Pepper,"So, how are we doing?"
234,Tony,Great. Just wrapping up here. Hey. You’re the boss.
235,Natalie,"Will that be all, Mr Stark?"
236,Tony,No.
237,Pepper,"Yes, that will be all, Ms Rushman. Thank you very much."
238,Tony,I want one.
239,Pepper,No.
240,Tony,"You know, it’s Europe. Whatever happens the next 20 minutes, just go with it."
241,Pepper,Go with it? Go with what?
242,Natalie,Mr Stark?
243,Tony,Hey.
244,Natalie,Hello. How was your flight?
245,Tony,"It was excellent. Boy, it’s nice to see you."
246,Natalie,"We have one photographer from the ACM, if you don’t mind. Okay?"
247,Pepper,When did this happen?
248,Tony,What? You made me do it.
249,Pepper,I made you do what?
250,Tony,"You quit. Smile. Look, right there. Stop acting constipated. Don’t flare your nostrils."
251,Pepper,You are so predictable.
252,Tony,That’s the amazing thing.
253,Natalie,Right this way.
254,Tony,You look fantastic.
255,Natalie,"Why, thank you very much."
256,Tony,But that’s unprofessional. What’s on the docket?
257,Natalie,You have a 9:30 dinner.
258,Tony,Perfect. I’ll be there at 11:00.
259,Natalie,Absolutely.
260,Tony,Is this us?
261,Natalie,It can be.
262,Tony,Great. Make it us.
263,Natalie,Okay.
264,Pepper,Mr Musk. How are you?
265,Mr Musk,"Hi, Pepper. Congratulations on the promotion."
266,Pepper,Thank you very much.
267,Tony,"Elon, how’s it going. Those Merlin engines are fantastic."
268,Mr Musk,"Thank you. Yeah, I’ve got an idea for an electric jet."
269,Tony,You do?
270,Mr Musk,Yeah.
271,Tony,Then we’ll make it work.  You want a massage?
272,Pepper,"Oh, God. No. I don’t want a massage."
273,Tony,I’ll have Natalie make an…
274,Pepper,I don’t want Natalie to do…
275,Tony,"Don’t want you tense. By the way, I didn’t mean to spring this on you."
276,Pepper,Thank you very much.
277,Tony,Green is not your best colour.
278,Pepper,"Oh, please."
279,Justin,Anthony. Is that you?
280,Tony,My least favourite person on Earth.
281,Justin,"Hey, pal."
282,Tony,Justin Hammer.
283,Justin,How you doing? You’re not the only rich guy here with a fancy car. You know Christine Everhart from Vanity Fair. You guys know each other?
284,Christine,Hi. Yes.
285,Pepper,Yes.
286,Tony,"Yes, roughly."
287,Pepper,We do.
288,Justin,"BTW, big story. The new CEO of Stark Industries."
289,Christine,"I know, I know."
290,Justin,Congratulations.
291,Christine,My editor will kill me if I don’t grab a quote for our Powerful Women issue.
292,Pepper,Oh.
293,Christine,Can I?
294,Pepper,Sure.
295,Justin,"She’s actually doing a big spread on me for Vanity Fair. I thought I’d throw her a bone, you know. Right?"
296,Pepper,"Right. Well, she did quite a spread on Tony last year."
297,Tony,And she wrote a story as well.
298,Pepper,It was very impressive.
299,Tony,That was good.
300,Pepper,It was very well done.
301,Christine,Thank you.
302,Pepper,I’m gonna go wash.
303,Tony,Don’t leave me.
304,Justin,"Hey, buddy. How you doing?"
305,Tony,I’m all right.
306,Justin,Looking gorgeous.
307,Tony,"Please, this is tough."
308,Christine,Can I ask you… Is this the first time…
309,Justin,Say “Brie”.
310,Christine,…that you guys have seen each other?
311,Tony,"God, that’s so awful."
312,Christine,"Listen, is it the first time you’ve seen each other since the Senate?"
313,Tony,Since he got his contract revoked…
314,Justin,"Actually, it’s on hold."
315,Tony,…when you were attempting to…That’s not what I heard. What’s the difference between “hold and “cancelled”? The truth?
316,Christine,"Yes, what is it?"
317,Justin,"No. The truth is… Why don’t we put that away? The truth is, I’m actually hoping to present something at your Expo."
318,Tony,"Well, if you invent something that works, I’ll make sure I get you a slot."
319,Natalie,Mr Stark?
320,Tony,Yes?
321,Natalie,Your corner table is ready.
322,Justin,"I actually have a slot this year. Yes, I do."
323,Tony,"Hammer needs a slot, Christine."
324,Justin,"We kid, yeah. We kid. We’re kidders."
325,Tony,Got any other bad ideas?
326,Justin,"Tony and I… Tony… I love Tony Stark. Tony loves me. We’re not competitors. Him being out of the picture created tremendous opportunities for Hammer Industries, you know? Everything that Tony and I do…"
327,Tony,"Well, what’s the use of having…"
328,Justin,…is a healthy…
329,Tony,…and owning a race car…
330,Justin,…competition.
331,Tony,…if you don’t drive it?
332,Justin,Is he driving?
333,Pepper,Natalie. Natalie!
334,Natalie,"Yes, Ms Potts?"
335,Pepper,What do you know about this?
336,Natalie,This is the first that I have known of it.
337,Pepper,"This, this cannot happen."
338,Natalie,Absolutely. I understand. How can I help you?
339,Pepper,Where’s Happy?
340,Natalie,He’s waiting outside.
341,Pepper,"Okay, get him. I need Happy."
342,Natalie,Right away.
343,Justin,"Tony’s… You know, he… We’re not competitive. You know what I mean?"
344,Christine,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, can you excuse me just one second?"
345,Justin,Just read me what you wrote.
346,Christine,"I will. I will, after."
347,Justin,Just read it back to me.
348,Christine,But I have to make one quick phone call.
349,Justin,Where are you going?
350,Christine,This is great.
351,Justin,I’ve got some caviar coming.
352,Christine,This is great stuff. I’ll be right back.
353,Someone in background,Look! That’s Stark.
354,Pepper,"Go, go."
355,Happy,Hang on.
356,Pepper,Give me the case.
357,Happy,"Here, take it."
358,Pepper,Where’s the key?
359,Happy,It’s in my pocket.
360,Pepper,Car!
361,Tony,Are you okay?
362,Happy,Yeah.
363,Tony,Were you heading from me or him?
364,Happy,I was trying to scare him.
365,Tony,‘Cause I can’t tell!
366,Pepper,Are you out of your mind?
367,Tony,Better security.
368,Pepper,Get in the car right now!
369,Tony,I was attacked. We need better security.
370,Happy,Get in the car.
371,Tony,"You’re CEO. Better security measures. God, it’s embarrassing."
372,Pepper,Oh my God!
373,Happy,I got him!
374,Tony,Hit him again. Hit him again. Football.
375,Happy,I got him.
376,Pepper,Take the case! Take it!
377,Tony,Give him the case!
378,Pepper,Stop banging the car!
379,Tony,Calm down.
380,Pepper,God. God.
381,Tony,Give me the case! Please! Come on!
382,Ivan,
383,Police officer,"We ran his prints. We got nothing back, not even a name."
384,Tony,Where are we going?
385,Police Officer,Over there. We’re not even sure he speaks English. He hasn’t said a word since he got here.
386,Tony,Five minutes.
387,Police officer,
388,Tony,"Pretty decent tech. Cycles per second were a little low. You could have doubled up your rotations. You focused the repulsor energy through ionised plasma channels. It’s effective. Not very efficient. But it’s a passable knock-off. I don’t get it. A little fine tuning you could have made a solid pay check. You could have sold it to North Korea, China, Iran, or gone onto the black market. You look like you got friends in low places."
389,Ivan,"You come from a family of thieves and butchers. And now, like all guilty men, you try to rewrite your own history. And you forget all the lives the Stark family has destroyed."
390,Tony,"Speaking of thieves, where did you get this design?"
391,Ivan,My father. Anton Vanko.
392,Tony,"Well, I never heard of him."
393,Ivan,My father is the reason you’re alive.
394,Tony,"The reason I’m alive is ‘cause you had a shot, you took it, you missed."
395,Ivan,"Did I? If you can make God bleed, the people will cease to believe in him. And there will be blood in the water. And the sharks will come. The truth, all I have to do is sit here and watch as the world will consume you."
396,Tony,Where will you be watching the world consume me from? That’s right. A prison cell. I’ll send you a bar of soap.
397,Ivan,"Hey, Tony. Before you go, palladium in the chest, painful way to die."
398,Stern,"It’s just unbelievable. It proves that the genie is out of the bottle and this man has no idea what he’s doing. He thinks of the Iron Man weapon as a toy. I was at a hearing where Mr Stark, in fact, was adamant that these suits can’t exist anywhere else, don’t exist anywhere else, never will exist anywhere else, at least for five to ten years, and here we are in Monaco realising, “These suits exist now.”"
399,Tony,Mute. He should be giving me a medal. That’s the truth.
400,Pepper,What is that?
401,Tony,This is your in-flight meal.
402,Pepper,Did you just make that?
403,Tony,Yeah. Where do you think I’ve been for three hours?
404,Pepper,"Tony, what are you not telling me?"
405,Tony,"I don’t want to go home. At all. Let’s cancel my birthday party and… We’re in Europe. Let’s go to Venice, Cipriani. Remember?"
406,Pepper,"Oh, yes."
407,Tony,It’s a great place to be healthy.
408,Pepper,I don’t think this is the right time. We’re in kind of a mess.
409,Tony,"Yeah, but maybe that’s why it’s the best time. ‘Cause then we can…"
410,Pepper,"Well, I think as the CEO I need to show up."
411,Tony,"As CEO, you are entitled to a leave."
412,Pepper,A leave?
413,Tony,A company retreat.
414,Pepper,A retreat? During a time like this?
415,Tony,"Just a ride. Well, I’m just saying, to recharge our batteries and figure it all out."
416,Pepper,Not everybody runs on batteries Tony.
417,Justin,"Hey. There he is. There he is. What an absolute pleasure. Welcome. Oh goodness gracious. Can we get the handcuffs off my friend here? Forgive me, I’m sorry. I’m such a huge fan of yours. I didn’t want to make a first impression like this. He’s not an animal. Come on. He’s a human being. Thank you. We’re fine. My name is Justin Hammer. I’d like to do some business with you. Please sit. Dig in. What do we have today Jack?"
418,Jack,We have some salmon carpaccio.
419,Justin,"Salmon carpaccio. Anything you want here, we got it. I like my dessert first. I had this flown in from San Francisco. It’s Italian though. Organic ice cream. I got a sweet tooth. Apparently you do too, for Tony Stark. What I saw you do to Tony Stark on that track, how you stepped up to him in front of God and everybody that was… Wow. You spoke to me with what you did. And I know that you knew that I’d be listening. This is why I couldn’t bear to have you shipped off to God knows where. It would have been such a waste of talent. But if I might make a suggestion, you know, you don’t just go and try to kill the guy. I think, if I may, you go after his legacy. That’s what you kill. You and me, we are a lot alike in a lot of ways. The only difference between you and I is that I have resources. I think, if I may, you need my resources. Someone behind you, a benefactor. I’d like to be that guy."
420,Ivan,
421,Justin,Okay. Do you speak English? Because I can get a translator. I don’t know. Have you been understanding everything I’m saying?
422,Ivan,"Very good, man."
423,Justin,"Very good, man."
424,Ivan,"Very good, man."
425,Justin,Hey!
426,Ivan,Hey.
427,Justin,Yes?
428,Ivan,I want my bird.
429,Justin,A bird? You want a bird?
430,Ivan,I want my bird.
431,Justin,I can get you a bird. I can get you ten birds.
432,Ivan,I want my bird.
433,Justin,"Well, okay. Nothing’s impossible. I could… Are we talking about… Is this a bird back in Russia?"
434,Pepper,"Yes, but the fundamentals of the company are still very, very strong despite the events in Monaco."
435,Natalie,The AP wants a quote.
436,Pepper,Don’t tell them. Fax them…
437,Rhodey,Where is he?
438,Natalie,He doesn’t want to be disturbed.
439,Pepper,He’s downstairs.
440,News reader,But what happened in Monaco?
441,Pepper,"Yes, but…."
442,News reader,"But his continuing erratic behaviour may lead many people to ask themselves, “Can this man still protect us?”"
443,Pepper,Iron Man never stopped protecting us. The events in Monaco proved that.
444,JARVIS,"Query complete sir. Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist who defected to the United States in 1963.However, he was accused of espionage and was deported in 1967. His son, Ivan, who is also a physicist, was convicted of selling Soviet-era weapons grade plutonium to Pakistan, and served 15 years in Kopeisk prison. No further records exist."
445,Rhodey,"Tony, you gotta get upstairs and get on top of this situation right now. Listen. I’ve been on the phone with the National Guard all day, trying to talk them out of rolling tanks up the PCH, knocking down your front door and taking these. They’re gonna take your suits, Tony, okay? They’re sick of the games. You said nobody else would possess this technology for 20 years. Well, guess what? Somebody else had it yesterday. It’s not theoretical anymore. Are you listening to me? Are you okay?"
446,Tony,Let’s go.
447,Rhodey,"Hey, man. Hey, hey! You all right?"
448,Tony,"Yeah, I should get to my desk.  See that cigar box?"
449,Rhodey,Yeah.
450,Tony,It’s palladium.
451,Rhodey,Is that supposed to be smoking?
452,Tony,"If you must know, it’s neutron damage. It’s from the reactor wall."
453,Rhodey,You had this in your body? And how about the high-tech crossword puzzle on your neck?
454,Tony,Road rash. Thank you.  What are you looking at?
455,Rhodey,I’m looking at you. You wanna do this whole lone gunslinger act and it’s unnecessary. You don’t have to do this alone.
456,Tony,"You know, I wish I could believe that. I really do. But you’ve gotta trust me. Contrary to popular belief, I know exactly what I’m doing."
457,Justin,"This is where we do it. This is my humble abode. You can work in absolute peace. Must be fun to be dead, right? No pressure. Here they are. I’m very excited. They’re combat-ready. I may have done a few miscalculations and rushed the prototype into production. Sue me, I’m enthusiastic. Go ahead, take a look around.  You don’t wanna do that. You’ll be able to access that as soon as we generate some encrypted pass codes. Can we generate some encrypted pass codes? Get some of those encrypted pass codes, Jack. Never mind, I… Wow. Okay. Good stuff."
458,Ivan,unintelligible
459,Justin,Sorry?
460,Ivan,Software shit.
461,Justin,"Well… You’re good. You really blasted in past the firewall there. Let me show you where you’re gonna be working primarily. Go ahead, take a look. Get a good look at that. That’s something, isn’t it? You know, those are really just for show and tell. They’re $125.7 million a pop, so… Wait!  Oh gosh. Jesus Christ. Get somebody up here. That’s where the pilot goes. I’m having a tough time finding volunteers. I’ll take care of that, just leave it."
462,Ivan,What you want them do?
463,Justin,"Well, long term, I want them to put me in the Pentagon for the next 25 years. I want to make Iron Man look like an antique. I wanna go to that Stark Expo, I wanna take a dump in Tony Stark’s front yard. You know what I’m talking about?"
464,Ivan,I can do that. No problem.
465,Justin,"Yeah? Hey, fabulous! I love it. Hey, this is our guy. Didn’t I tell you? I had a feeling."
466,Natalie,"Do you know which watch you’d like to wear tonight, Mr Stark?"
467,Tony,I’ll give them a look. I should cancel the party.
468,Natalie,Probably.
469,Tony,Yeah. ‘Cause it’s…
470,Natalie,Ill-timed.
471,Tony,"Right, sends the wrong message."
472,Natalie,Inappropriate.  Is that dirty enough for you?
473,Tony,"Gold face, brown hand. The Jaeger. I’ll give that a look. Bring them over.  I gotta say it. It’s hard to get a read on you. Where are you from?"
474,Natalie,Legal.
475,Tony,"Can I ask you a question, hypothetically? Bit odd. If this was your last birthday party you were ever gonna have, how would you celebrate it?"
476,Natalie,I’d do whatever I wanted to do with whoever I wanted to do it with.
477,Person,Good evening
478,Person,Good evening
479,Rhodey,"Yes, sir, I understand. No. No, sir, that will not be necessary. I’ll handle it. Sir, I personally guarantee that within 24 hours, Iron Man will be back on watch.  Hey Pepper."
480,Pepper,I’m going to get some air.
481,Rhodey,What’s wrong?
482,Pepper,I don’t know what to do.
483,Rhodey,"You gotta be kidding me.  That’s it, I’m making…."
484,Pepper,"No, no, no. Don’t call anyone."
485,Rhodey,Pepper. This is ridiculous. I just stuck my neck out for this guy.
486,Pepper,"I know. I know. I get it. I’m gonna handle it, okay Just let me handle it."
487,Rhodey,Handle it. Or I’m gonna have to.
488,Tony,
489,Pepper,Does this guy know how to throw a party or what?
490,Tony,I love you.
491,Pepper,"Unbelievable! Thank you so much. Tony, we all thank you so much for such a wonderful night. And we’re gonna say good night now, and thank you all for coming."
492,Tony,"No, no, no, we can’t … Wait, wait, wait. We didn’t have the cake. We didn’t blow out the candles."
493,Pepper,"You’re out of control, okay? Trust me on this, okay?"
494,Tony,You’re out of control gorgeous.
495,Pepper,It’s time to go to bed. It’s time.
496,Tony,Give me another smooch
497,Pepper,You’re not going to be happy about this.
498,Tony,"Come on, you know you want to."
499,Pepper,You just peed in the suit.
500,Tony,I know. It has a filtration system.
501,Pepper,It’s not sexy.
502,Tony,You could drink that water.
503,Pepper,"Just send everybody home, okay? It’s time to…"
504,Tony,If you say so.
505,Pepper,"Okay. I’ll take this, you take that"
506,Tony,"Pepper Potts. She’s right. The party’s over. Then again, the party was over for me, like, an hour and a half ago. The after-party starts in 15 minutes. And if anybody, Pepper, doesn’t like it, there’s the door.  I think she wants the Gallagher!"
507,Rhodey,You don’t deserve to wear one of these. Shut it down!
508,Tony,Goldstein.
509,Goldstein,"Yes, Mr Stark?"
510,Tony,Give me a phat beat to beat my buddy’s ass to.
511,Rhodey,
512,Tony,"Now, put that thing back where you found it before someone gets hurt.  Sorry, pal, but Iron Man doesn’t have a sidekick."
513,Rhodey,Had enough?
514,Pepper,Natalie!
515,Natalie,Miss Potts.
516,Pepper,Don’t you “Miss Potts” me! I’m on to you. You know what? Ever since you came here…
517,Happy,Pepper!
518,Tony,You want it? Take it!
519,Rhodey,Put you hand down.
520,Tony,You think you got what it takes to wear that suit?
521,Rhodey,"We don’t have to do this, Tony."
522,Tony,"You wanna be the War Machine, take your shot."
523,Rhodey,Put it down!
524,Tony,You gonna take a shot?
525,Rhodey,Put it down!
526,Tony,No!
527,Rhodey,Drop it Tony!
528,Tony,Take it!
529,Rhodey,"Edwards Tower, this is Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes, inbound from three miles east at 5,000 feet…"
530,Major Allen,Colonel.
531,Rhodey,Major.
532,Major Allen,Wow.
533,Rhodey,Yeah. Let’s take it inside.
534,Major Allen,Clear the area.
535,Nick Fury,Sir! I’m gonna have to ask you to exit the doughnut.
536,Tony,I told you I don’t wanna join your super-secret boy band.
537,Fury,"No, no, no. See, I remember, you do everything yourself. How’s that working out for you?"
538,Tony,It’s… It’s… It’s… I’m sorry. I don’t wanna get off on the wrong foot. Do I look at the patch or the eye? Honestly I’m a bit hung over. I’m not sure if you’re real of if I’m having…
539,Fury,I am very real. I’m the realest person you’re ever gonna meet.
540,Tony,Just my luck. Where’s the staff here?
541,Fury,That’s not looking so good.
542,Tony,I’ve been worse.
543,SHIELD agent,We’ve secured the perimeter but I don’t think we should hold it for too much longer.
544,Tony,You’re fired.
545,Natalie,That’s not up to you.
546,Fury,"Tony, I want you to meet Agent Romanoff."
547,Tony,Hi.
548,Natalie/Agent Romanoff,"I’m a SHIELD shadow. Once we knew you were ill, I was tasked to you by Director Fury."
549,Tony,I suggest you apologise.
550,Fury,"You’ve been very busy. You made your girl your CEO, you’re giving away all your stuff. You let your friend fly away with your suit. Now, if I didn’t know better…"
551,Tony,You don’t know better. I didn’t give it to him. He took it.
552,Fury,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it? You’re Iron Man and he just took it? The little brother walked in there, kicked your ass and took your suit?  Is that possible?"
553,Agent Romanoff,"Well, according to Mr Stark’s database security guidelines, there are redundancies to prevent unauthorised usage."
554,Tony,What do you want from me?
555,Fury,What do we want from you? What do you want from me?  Hit him.
556,Tony,"Oh, God, are gonna steal my kidney and sell it?  Could you please not do anything awful for five seconds? What did she just do to me?"
557,Fury,What did we just do for you? That’s lithium dioxide. It’s gonna take the edge off. We’re trying to get you back to work.
558,Tony,Give me a couple of boxes of that. I’ll be right as rain.
559,Agent Romanoff,"It’s not a cure, it just abates the symptoms."
560,Fury,Doesn’t look like it’s gonna be an easy fix.
561,Tony,"Trust me, I know. I’m good at this stuff. I’ve been looking for a suitable replacement for palladium. I’ve tried every combination, every permutation of every known element."
562,Fury,"Well, I’m here to tell you, you haven’t tried them all."
563,Justin,"Hey, hey, het. Special delivery. Candygram.  We got you the bird, pal."
564,Ivan,This is not my bird.
565,Justin,"What do you mean? That’s the bird. This is the bird. Yeah, pulled a lot of strings to get this bird. This is a great bird."
566,Jack,It’s a beautiful bird.
567,Justin,We got this bird all the way from Russia.
568,Ivan,"Hey, man, this is not my bird."
569,Justin,"Well, listen, even if it’s not the bird, I mean, this is a gorgeous bird. I mean, you know, look, don’t get so attached to things. Learn to let go. Wait a minute. Jack, what is that? Is that… That’s not a helmet. What is that?  Ivan… What’s this? Jack. Is that a helmet? It doesn’t look like a helmet to me. How… How are you supposed to get a head in there? Jack, could you put your head in there?"
570,Jack,No.
571,Justin,"Try to put your head in there. Go ahead. Try to put your head in there.  See, Ivan? He can’t put his head in there. That’s… That’s not a helmet. It’s a head. I need to put a guy in there. I need to fit a person in that suit. You understand?"
572,Ivan,Drone better.
573,Justin,What? Drone better? Why is drone better? Why is drone better?
574,Ivan,People make problem. Trust me. Drone better.
575,Justin,"Ivan, you know, I like you. I got you the bird. You said, “No problem.” That’s what you said to me. You said, “No problem.” Now I need suits. The government wants suits. Like Iron Man. You understand? That’s what the people want. That’s what’s gonna make them happy."
576,Ivan,"Hey, man. Don’t get too attached to things. Learn to let go."
577,Justin,"These drones better steal the show, Ivan. You understand? Better rock my world, Ivan."
578,General,Unbelievable. This ought to get the Senate off my ass. It’s functional?
579,Rhodey,Fully mission-capable.
580,General,Good. Get Hammer down here to weaponise it.
581,Rhodey,Sir?
582,General,Justin Hammer’s making a weapons presentation at the Expo. We’d like this to introduce it.
583,Rhodey,"Sir, I don’t believe that the Expo…"
584,General,"Colonel, the world needs to see this fast. We’ve got to make this happen."
585,Rhodey,"Yes, General, but…"
586,General,It’s also an order.
587,Rhodey,Yes sir.
588,General,"Good work, Colonel. You’ve made your country proud."
589,Rhodey,Thank you sir.
590,Fury,That thing in your chest is based on unfinished technology.
591,Tony,"No, it was finished. It has never been particularly effective until I miniaturised it and put it in my…"
592,Fury,"No. Howard said the arc reactor was the stepping stone to something greater. He was about to kick off an energy race that was gonna dwarf the arms race. He was on to something big, something so big that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor look like a triple-A battery."
593,Tony,"Just him, or Anton Vanko in on this too?"
594,Fury,"Anton Vanko is the other side of that coin. Anton saw it as a way to get rich. When your father found out, he had him deported. When the Russians found out he couldn’t deliver they shipped his ass off to Siberia and he spent the next 20 years in a vodka-fuelled rage. Not quite the environment you want to raise a kid in, the son you had the misfortune of crossing paths with in Monaco."
595,Tony,You told me I hadn’t tried everything. What do you mean I haven’t tried everything? What haven’t I tried?
596,Fury,He said that you were the only person with the means and knowledge to finish what he started.
597,Tony,He said that?
598,Fury,"Are you that guy? Are you? ‘Cause if you are, then you can solve the riddle of your heart."
599,Tony,"I don’t know where you get your information, but he wasn’t my biggest fan."
600,Fury,What do you remember about your dad?
601,Tony,"He was cold, he was calculating. He never told me he loved me. He never even told me he liked me, so it’s a little tough for me to digest when you’re telling me he said the whole future was riding on me and he’s passing it down. I don’t get that. You’re talking about a guy who’s happiest day was when he shipped me off to boarding school."
602,Fury,That’s not true.
603,Tony,"Well, then, clearly you knew my dad better than I did."
604,Fury,"As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of the founding members of SHIELD."
605,Tony,What?
606,Fury,I got a two o’clock
607,Tony,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. What’s this?"
608,Fury,"Okay, you’re good, right?"
609,Tony,"No, I’m not good."
610,Fury,You got this? Right? Right?
611,Tony,Got what? I don’t even know what I’m supposed to get.
612,Fury,"Natasha will remain a floater at Stark with her cover intact. You remember Agent Coulson, right?"
613,Tony,Yeah.
614,Fury,"And Tony, remember, I got my eye on you."
615,Natalie/Agent Romanoff/Natasha,We’ve disabled all communications. No contact with the outside world. Good luck.
616,Tony,"Please. First thing, I need a little bodywork. I’ll put in a little time at the lab. If we could send one of your goon squad down to The Coffee Bean, Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run, or something like that, that’d be nice."
617,Agent Coulson,"I’m not here for that. I’ve been authorised by Director Fury to use any means necessary to keep you on premises. If you attempt to leave or play any games, I will tase you and watch Supernanny while you drool into the carpet. Okay?"
618,Tony,"I think I got it, yeah."
619,Agent Coulson,Enjoy your evening’s entertainment.
620,Major Allen,Think this is the power source?
621,Rhodey,"Major, this is not a scientific exercise. Let’s just focus on arming it, all right?"
622,Major Allen,"Yes, sir."
623,Justin,"Oh, yes! Oh, yes, yes, yes. Is it my birthday? You got it. What did you do? What did you do? Is this what I think it is?"
624,Rhodey,"Yes it is. Hammer, I want to know what you’re gonna do for us."
625,Justin,"What am I going to do for you? Well, the first thing I’m gonna do for you is I’m gonna upgrade your software. And then, second, I think I should…"
626,Rhodey,That’s not what I’m talking about. I’m talking about firepower.
627,Justin,"Well, you’re talking to the right guy.  Claridge Hi-Tec, semi-automatic, 9mm pistol. Too downtown? I agree. M24 shotgun, pump action. Five-round magazine. You know what? You’re not a hunter. What am I talking about? I’m getting rid of it. This is the FN-2000 from Belgium. They do make something better than waffles. It’s beautiful, But I can tell this isn’t disco enough for you, so I’m gonna put it right here. You’re looking at a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher. Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control. You’re tough. Let me tell you something. Size does matter. Don’t let anyone tell you different. This is an M134 7.62 Minigun. Six invidual barrels. The torso taker, powder maker. Our boys in uniform call in Uncle Gazpacho or Puff the Magic Dragon. Okay. These are the Cubans, baby. This is the Cohibas, the Montecristos. This is a kinetic-kill, side-winder vehicle with a secondary cyclotrimethlyenetrinitamine RDX burst. It’s capable of busting the bunker under the bunker you just busted. If it were any smarter, it would write a book. A book that would make Ulysses look like it was written in crayon. It would read it to you. This is my Eiffel Tower. This is my Rachmaninoff’s Third. My Pieta. It’s completely elegant. It’s bafflingly beautiful. And it’s capable of reducing the population of any standing structure to zero. I call it the Ex-Wife. That’s the best I got. Are we gonna do this? Give me something here. You’re like a sphinx. I can’t read you."
628,Rhodey,I think I’ll take it.
629,Justin,Which one?
630,Rhodey,All of it.
631,Justin,All of it.
632,Howard,"Everything is achievable through technology. Better living, robust heath,"
633,Man,"All right, I think we got…"
634,Howard,I’ll… I’ll… I’ll come in and…
635,Man,Are you waiting on me?
636,Howard,"So, from all of us at Stark Industries, I’d like to personally show you my ass. I’d like to… I can’t… This is… I can’t… We have this, don’t we? This is a ridiculous way… Everything  Tony. You’re too young to understand this right now, so I thought I would put it on film for you. I built this for you. And someday you’ll realise that it represents a whole lot more than just people’s inventions. It represents my life’s work. This is the key to the future. I’m limited by the technology of my time, but one day you’ll figure this out. And when you do, you will change the world. What is and always will be my greatest creation is you. [Tony looks like he’s about to cry as the film ends."
637,Tony,How much?
638,Strawberry man,$6. Six.
639,Tony,I don’t have any dough. Here.
640,Strawberry man,"No, sir, that’s too much."
641,Tony,"No, it’s fine. Take that. It’s fine"
642,Strawberry man,"No, señor."
643,Tony,"Take it. Take it. I don’t like people handing me things. If you just drop that there, that’d be great."
644,Strawberry man,Are you Iron Man?
645,Tony,Sometimes.
646,Strawberry man,We believe in you!
647,Pepper,It was an illegal seizure of trademark property.
648,PA,Miss Potts?
649,Tony,Relax.
650,PA,Mr Stark…
651,Tony,Is here.
652,PA,He refuses…
653,Tony,I don’t. It’s fine. I’ll just be a second.
654,Pepper,"Listen, it’s our position that Stark has and continues to maintain propriety ownership of the Mark II platform."
655,News reporter,"When Mr Stark announced he was indeed Iron Man, he was making a promise to America."
656,Pepper,"No, the suit belongs to us."
657,News reporter,We trusted that he would look out for us.
658,Pepper,"Yeah, but you’re not…"
659,News reporter,He obviously did not.
660,Pepper,Burt…
661,News reporter,And now we learn that his secretary…
662,Pepper,"Yes, it does."
663,News reporter,"…a woman named Virginia “Pepper” Potts, has been appointed as CEO of Stark Industries. What are her qualifications?"
664,Pepper,No.
665,News reporter,Miss Potts has done nothing to manage this terrible…
666,Tony,Mute.
667,Pepper,"No… Burt… Burt… Burt, listen to me. Don’t tell me that we have the best patent lawyers in the country and then not let me pursue this."
668,Tony,I’ll get this stuff out of here.
669,Pepper,"Well, then, tell the President to sign an order. We’ll talk about it at the Expo.  Hammer’s giving some presentation tomorrow evening. Will Tony Stark be there?"
670,Tony,Will I?
671,Pepper,"No, he will not. Bye."
672,Tony,I would like to be. Got a minute?
673,Pepper,No.
674,Tony,"Come on, you just got off the phone. You’re fine. 30 seconds."
675,Pepper,Twenty-nine Twenty-eight.
676,Tony,"I was just driving over here, and I thought I was coming to basically apologise, but I’m not."
677,Pepper,You didn’t come here to apologise?
678,Tony,"Look, that goes without saying, and I’m working on that. But I haven’t been entirely upfront with you, and I just want to try to make good. Can I move this? This is crazy. It’s like a Ferris wheel, going. I’m trying to get some…"
679,Pepper,No.
680,Tony,"Do you know how short life is? And if I never got to express… And by the way, this is somewhat revelatory to me. And I don’t care… I mean, I care. It would be nice. I’m not expecting you to… Look, here’s what I’m trying to say. I’m just gonna say it."
681,Pepper,"Let me stop you right here, okay? Because if you say “I” one more time, I’m gonna actually hurl something at your head, I think. I am trying to run a company. Do you have any idea what that entails?"
682,Tony,Yes.
683,Pepper,"People are relying on you to be Iron Man and you’ve disappeared, and all I’m doing is putting out your fires and taking the heat of it. I am trying to do the job that you were meant to do. Did you bring me strawberries? Did you know that there’s only one thing on Earth that I’m allergic to?"
684,Tony,Allergic to strawberries. This is progress Pepper. I knew there was a correlation between you and this.
685,Pepper,I need you…
686,Tony,I need you too.
687,Pepper,…to leave now
688,Tony,That’s what I’m trying to…
689,Natasha,Ms Potts?
690,Pepper,"Hi, come on in."
691,Natasha,Wheels up in 25 minutes.
692,Pepper,Thank you.
693,Happy,"Anything else, boss?"
694,Tony,"I’m good, Hap."
695,Pepper,"No, I’ll be just another minute."
696,Tony,"I lost both the kids in the divorce.  Are you blending in well here, Natalie? Here are Stark Enterprises? Your name is Natalie, isn’t it? I thought you two didn’t get along?"
697,Pepper,No. That’s not so.
698,Tony,It’s just me you don’t care for. No? Nothing?
699,Pepper,"Actually, while you’re here maybe you and Natalie could discuss the matter of the personal belongings."
700,Natasha,Absolutely.  I’m surprised you can keep your mouth shut.
701,Tony,"Boy, you’re good. You are mind-blowingly duplicitous. How do you do it? You just tear things… You’re a triple imposter. I’ve never seen anything like you. Is there anything real about you? Do you even speak Latin?"
702,Natasha,
703,Tony,Which means? Wait. What? What did you just say?
704,Natasha,It means you can either drive yourself home or I can have you collected.
705,Tony,You’re good. [Piles things up under desk spinny thing and throws strawberries in the bin. Goes back to the model and looks at it through one eye.
706,Tony,"Jarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form a digital wire frame? I need a manipulatable projection."
707,Jarvis,"1974 Stark Expo model scan complete, sir."
708,Tony,How many buildings are there?
709,Jarvis,Am I to include the Belgium waffle stands?
710,Tony,That was rhetorical. Just show me.  What does that look like to you Jarvis? Not unlike an atom. In which case the nucleus would be here. Highlight the unisphere. Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them.
711,Jarvis,"What is it you’re trying to achieve, sir?"
712,Tony,"I’m discovering… Correction. I’m rediscovering a new element, I believe. Lose the landscaping, the shrubbery, the trees."
713,Jarvis,The proposed element should serve as a viable replacement for palladium.
714,Tony,Thank Dad.
715,Jarvis,"Unfortunately, it is impossible to synthesise."
716,Tony,"Get ready for a major remodel, fellas. We’re back in hardware mode."
717,Agent Coulson,I heard you broke the perimeter.
718,Tony,"Yeah. That was, like, three years ago. Where have you been?"
719,Agent Coulson,I was doing some stuff.
720,Tony,"Yeah, well, me too and it worked. Hey, I’m playing for the home team Coulson, you and all your Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. Now, are you gonna let me work or break my balls?"
721,Agent Coulson,What’s this doing here?
722,Tony,That’s it. Bring that to me.
723,Agent Coulson,You know what this is?
724,Tony,Perfectly level. I’m busy. What do you want?
725,Agent Coulson,Nothing. Goodbye. I’ve been reassigned. Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.
726,Tony,Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.
727,Agent Coulson,So I’m told.
728,Tony,Secret stuff?
729,Agent Coulson,Something like that. Good luck.
730,Tony,Bye. Thanks.
731,Agent Coulson,We need you.
732,Tony,"Yeah, more than you know."
733,Agent Coulson,Not that much.
734,Jarvis,Initialising prismatic accelerator.
735,Tony,That was easy.
736,Jarvis,"Congratulations sir. You have created a new element.  Sir, the reactor has accepted the modified core. I will begin running diagnostics."
737,Justin,Hey Ivan. I got Senator Stern here. Thought we’d swing over and look at some of the drone designs.
738,Ivan,The drone is not going to be ready.
739,Justin,Not ready? What do you mean?
740,Ivan,"I can make presentation, not demonstration."
741,Justin,What the hell is the difference?
742,Ivan,Presentation. No fly. No shoot.
743,Justin,"Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. What can you make them do? I mean, this is a weapons demonstration."
744,Ivan,I can make salute.
745,Justin,"You can make salute? What do you mean “make salute”? What the hell does that mean Ivan? This is not what we agreed to, okay? You promised me suits and then you promised me drones."
746,Ivan,"Hey, man, everything will be okay."
747,Justin,This is not what I wanted.
748,Justin,"Hey, there he is. It’s the bird man. Now you like the bird. Is that right? Is that your bird? I’m confused. You said it wasn’t, but now it looks like you’re the best of pals. You love that bird, don’t you? You know what? Take the bird."
749,Ivan,Hey!
750,Justin,"Take his pillows too. Both of them. And his shoes. Take his shoes. I took your stuff. How does that make you feel? Do you feel bad? Good. ‘Cause that’s how I feel! We had a contract. I saved your life and you give me suits. That was our deal. And you did not deliver. I don’t know if you’re a genius or a fraud. I don’t know what you are. Something really, really great fell into my lap. And if it hadn’t, I’d be at your mercy tonight. Now I have a piece of Stark tech that I pimped out myself. And now your overpriced paperweights and gonna look like a backdrop to my demonstration. Do you dig what I’m getting at here?"
751,Ivan,unintelligible
752,Justin,"I don’t know if you know this, but I don’t speak Russian! I’m gonna leave now. I’m gonna go to the Expo. Maybe I’ll even get laid. You see these guys? They’re your babysitters. They are not to be trifled with. When I get back, we’re gonna renegotiate the terms of our agreement. And you’re gonna make good on our arrangement because if you don’t, you’re gonna be exactly what you were when I found you, a dead man. You got that? Maybe you can watch me on TV."
753,Tony,"Dummy, You, can we clean up this mess? You’re killing me. You know I don’t…"
754,Jarvis,Incoming call with a blocked number sir.
755,Tony,My phone privilege is reinstated. Lovely. Coulson. How’s the Land of Enchantment?
756,Ivan,"Hey, Tony, how you doing? I double cycle."
757,Tony,You what?
758,Ivan,You told me double cycle’s more power. Good advice.
759,Tony,You sound pretty sprightly for a dead guy.
760,Ivan,You too.
761,Tony,Trace him.
762,Jarvis,Sir.
763,Ivan,"Now, the true history of Stark name will be written."
764,Tony,"Jarvis, where is he?"
765,Jarvis,Accessing the Oracle grid. Eastern Seaboard.
766,Ivan,"What your father did to my family over 40 years, I will do to you in 40 minutes."
767,Tony,Sounds good. Let’s get together and hash it out.
768,Jarvis,Tri-State area. Manhattan and outlying boroughs.
769,Ivan,I hope you’re ready.
770,Jarvis,Call trace incomplete.
771,Jarvis,Sir
772,Tony,"You want to run some tests, run them. And assemble the suit while you’re at it. Put it together now."
773,Jarvis,We are unclear as to the effects.
774,Tony,"I don’t want to hear it Jarvis.  That tastes like coconut. And metal. Oh wow, yeah!"
775,Happy,"I’ll keep the car down here, all right?"
776,Pepper,Thank you Happy.
777,Announcer,…Justin Hammer. His presentation will begin shortly in the main pavilion.
778,Justin,"Yeah. That’s what I’m talking about. Thanks for coming. Ladies and gentlemen, for far too long, this country has had to place its brave men and women in harm’s way, but then the Iron Man arrived, and we thought the days of losing lives were behind us. Sadly, that technology was kept out of reach. That’s not fair. That’s not right. And it’s just too bad."
779,Pepper,"Oh, Lord."
780,Justin,"Regardless, it was an impressive innovation, one that grabbed the headlines the world over. Well, today, my friends, the press is faced with quite a difficult problem. They are about to run out of ink.  Ladies and gentlemen, today I am proud to present to you the very first prototype in the Variable Threat Response Battle Suit and its pilot, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes."
781,Pepper,What?
782,Justin,"For America and its allies, Hammer Industries is reporting for…"
783,Tony,We got trouble.
784,Rhodey,"Tony, there are civilians present. I’m here on orders. Let’s not do this right now."
785,Tony,Give them a wave.
786,Justin,"Hey, all right. Yeah."
787,Tony,All these people are in danger. We gotta get them out of here. You gotta trust me for the next five minutes.
788,Rhodey,"Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed around your house, remember?"
789,Tony,"Listen, I think he’s working with Vanko."
790,Rhodey,Vanko’s alive?
791,Justin,Yeah.
792,Tony,What is he?
793,Justin,What?
794,Tony,Where’s Vanko?
795,Justin,Who?
796,Tony,Tell me.
797,Justin,What are you doing here man?
798,Rhodey,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
799,Tony,Is that you?
800,Rhodey,"No, I’m not doing that. That’s not me. I can’t move. I’m locked up. I’m locked up!  Get out of here. Go! This whole system’s been compromised."
801,Tony,
802,Rhodey,"No, no!"
803,Tony,"Jarvis, break in. I need to own him."
804,Jarvis,Yes sir.
805,Rhodey,"Tony, Tony, I’m locked on. I have target lock."
806,Tony,On what?
807,Rhodey,"On you.  Tony, on your six!"
808,Justin,What’s going on? What’s happening?
809,Technician,The software’s been overridden.
810,Justin,What? What do you mean it’s been overridden? What does that mean?
811,Technician,I think he slaved the drones.
812,Justin,That’s impossible. Call the guards.
813,Jack,All the phones are down sir.
814,Justin,"Well, then call their… Call their cells."
815,Jack,Their cell phones are not working either sir.
816,Technician,He’s locked us out of the mainframe.
817,Pepper,Who’s locked you out of the mainframe?
818,Justin,"Please, please, go away. Go away. I’ve got this handled."
819,Pepper,Have you now?
820,Justin,"Yes, I do. In fact, if your guy hadn’t showed up, this wouldn’t be happening. So, please, now go away. Thank you  Listen, we got to get these bitches out of here. What?"
821,Natasha,You tell me who’s behind this. Who’s behind this?
822,Justin,Ivan. Ivan Vanko.
823,Natasha,Where is he?
824,Justin,At my facility.
825,Pepper,"I need NYPD, please."
826,Justin,"No, no, no!"
827,Pepper,Command Central.
828,Justin,"No, no, honey. Don’t call the authorities."
829,Pepper,Okay. Right away. Right away.  Tell me everything you know. Go.
830,Tony,How are we doing Jarvis?
831,Jarvis,Remote reboot unsuccessful.
832,Security guard,This way.
833,Happy,Nobody’s answering the phone. What’s going on?
834,Natasha,Get in the car. Take me to Hammer Industries.
835,Happy,I’m not taking you anywhere.
836,Natasha,Fine. You want me to drive?
837,Happy,"No, I’m driving. Get in the car."
838,Tony,Nice work kid.
839,Rhodey,You got multiples coming in on you.
840,Tony,Let’s get this away from the Expo.
841,Natasha,"Wen we arrive, I need you to watch the perimeter.  I’m gonna enter the facility and take down the target. Watch the road."
842,Happy,I got it. I got it.
843,Rhodey,"Listen, listen. A pack just peeled off. They’re headed back to the Expo."
844,Tony,Got it.
845,Rhodey,In closing in on you. Ordnance coming in hot Tony. Watch it.
846,Natasha,Stay in the car.
847,Happy,I’m not staying in the car.
848,Natasha,"I said, stay in the car."
849,Happy,"What are you wearing? Look, I’m not letting you go in there alone."
850,Natasha,You want to help? Keep the car running.
851,Happy,Okay.
852,Hammer security guard,"Hey, hey, hey. You can’t come in here."
853,Second guard,Hold on. Hey!
854,Technician,Each set of drone is communicating in its own unique language.
855,Pepper,"Well, choose one and focus on that."
856,Justin,Have you tried Russian? Why don’t you try Russian?
857,Announcement,Attention. We have intrusion on Grid W.
858,Security guard,We got it. We’re on our way.
859,Happy,I got him! [Sees what Natasha has done
860,Tony,"Rhodey, you still locked on?"
861,Rhodey,Yeah.
862,Tony,Drop your socks and grab your Crocs. We’re about to get wet on this ride.
863,Rhodey,"Wait, wait, wait!"
864,Natasha,He’s gone.
865,Tony,I’m sorry buddy. Had to thin out the herd. What’s your 20?
866,Happy,What are you doing?
867,Natasha,I’m rebooting Rhodey’s suit.
868,Rhodey,Tony.
869,Natasha,Reboot complete  You got your best friend back.
870,Tony,"Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff."
871,Natasha,Well done on the new chest piece. I am reading significant higher output and your vitals all look promising.
872,Tony,"Yes, for the moment, I’m not dying. Thank you."
873,Pepper,What do you mean you’re not dying? Did you just say you’re dying?
874,Tony,"Is that you? No, I’m not. Not anymore."
875,Pepper,What’s going on?
876,Tony,I was going to tell you. I didn’t want to alarm you.
877,Pepper,You were gonna tell me? You really were dying?
878,Tony,You didn’t let me.
879,Pepper,Why didn’t you tell me that?
880,Tony,I was gonna make you an omelette and tell you.
881,Natasha,"Hey, hey. Save it for the honeymoon. You got incoming Tony. Looks like the fight’s coming to you."
882,Tony,Great. Pepper?
883,Pepper,Are you okay now?
884,Tony,I am fine. Don’t be mad. I will formally apologise…
885,Pepper,I am mad!
886,Tony,…when I’m not fending off a Hammeroid attack.
887,Pepper,Fine.
888,Tony,We could have been in Venice.
889,Pepper,Oh please.
890,Tony,"Rhodes? Snap out of it buddy. I need you. They’re coming. Come on, let’s roll. Get up."
891,Rhodey,"Oh, man. You can have your suit back."
892,Tony,You okay?
893,Rhodey,"Yeah, thanks. Tony, look, I’m sorry, okay?"
894,Tony,Don’t be.
895,Rhodey,No. I should have trusted you more.
896,Tony,I’m the one who put you in this position. Forget it.
897,Rhodey,No. It’s your fault. I just wanted to say I’m sorry.
898,Tony,"Thank you. That’s all I wanted to hear. Partner. They’re coming in hot, any second. What’s the play?"
899,Rhodey,"Well, we want to take the high ground, okay? So let’s put the biggest gun up on that ridge."
900,Tony,Got you. Where do you want to be?
901,Rhodey,Where are you going?
902,Tony,What’re you talking about?
903,Rhodey,I meant me.
904,Tony,You have a big gun. You are not the big gun.
905,Rhodey,"Tony, don’t be jealous."
906,Tony,No. It’s subtle all the bells and whistles.
907,Rhodey,Yeah. It’s called being a badass.
908,Tony,Fine. All right. You go up to. I’ll draw them in.
909,Rhodey,Don’t stay down here. This is the worst place to be.
910,Tony,"Okay, you got a spot. Where’s mine?"
911,Rhodey,"It’s the kill box, Tony. Okay This is where you go to die."
912,Tony,See that?
913,Rhodey,"Yeah, yeah. Nice."
914,Tony,Rhodey? Get down.
915,Rhodey,Wow. I think you should lead with that next time.
916,Tony,Yeah. Sorry boss. I can only use it one. It’s a one-off.
917,Justin,I told you that five minutes ago.
918,Pepper,That’s your guy here.
919,Justin,Excuse me?
920,Police officer,You’re being placed under arrest.
921,Justin,Are you kidding me?
922,Police officer,Hands behind your back sir.
923,Justin,"I’m trying to help here. I get it. I see what you’re doing. You’re trying to pin this on me, huh? That’s good. That’s good. You’re starting to think like a CEO, taking out the competition. I like that. You think you’re making a problem for me?  I’m gonna make a problem for you. I’m gonna be seeing you again real soon."
924,Pepper,"When they get here, I think you should station them at the south, east and both west exits."
925,Police officer,We shut down the 7 train in and out of Willets Point already.
926,Pepper,"Well, have city buses there to ferry people to operating lines."
927,Police officer,Yeah. Are you coming with us?
928,Pepper,"No, I’m gonna stay until to park is clear."
929,Police officer,Okay.
930,Natasha,Head up. You got one more drone incoming. This one looks different.  The repulsor signature is significantly higher.
931,Ivan,Good to be back.
932,Rhodey,This ain’t gonna be good.  I got something special for this guy. I’m gonna bust his bunker with the Ex-Wife.
933,Tony,With the what?  Hammer tech?
934,Rhodey,Yeah.
935,Tony,I got this.  Rhodes. I got an idea. You want to be a hero?
936,Rhodey,What?
937,Tony,I could really use a sidekick. Put your hand up.
938,Rhodey,This is your idea?
939,Tony,Yep.
940,Rhodey,"I’m ready. I’m ready. Go, go, go!"
941,Tony,Take it!
942,Ivan,You lose.
943,Rhodey,All these drones are rigged to blow. We gotta get out of here man.
944,Tony,Pepper?
945,Pepper,Oh my God. I can’t take this anymore.
946,Tony,You can’t?
947,Pepper,I can’t take this.
948,Tony,Look at me.
949,Pepper,"My body, literally, cannot handle the stress. I never know if you’re gonna kill yourself or wreak the whole company."
950,Tony,I think I did okay.
951,Pepper,I quit. I’m resigning. That’s it.
952,Tony,"What did you just say? You’re done? That’s surprising. No, it’s not surprising. I get it. You don’t have to make excuses."
953,Pepper,I’m… I’m… I’m not making any excuses.
954,Tony,You actually were just making excuses. But you don’t have to.
955,Pepper,"No, I wasn’t making an excuse. I’m actually very justified."
956,Tony,"Listen. Hey, hey. You deserve better."
957,Pepper,Well…
958,Tony,"You’ve taken such good care of me. I’ve been in a tough spot, but you got me through it, so… Right?"
959,Pepper,Thank you.
960,Tony,Yeah.
961,Pepper,Thank you for understanding.
962,Tony,"Yeah, yeah. Let’s talk clean-up."
963,Pepper,I’ll handle the transition. It’ll be smooth.
964,Tony,Okay. What about the press? Because you only had the job for a week. That’s gonna seem…
965,Pepper,"Well, with you it’s like dog years."
966,Tony,I know.
967,Pepper,"I mean, it’s like the Presidency."
968,Tony,Weird.
969,Pepper,"No, it’s not weird."
970,Tony,"It’s okay, right?"
971,Pepper,Yeah.
972,Tony,Run that by me again.
973,Rhodey,I think it was weird.  You guys look like two seals fighting over a grape.
974,Pepper,"I had just quit, actually."
975,Tony,"Yeah, so we’re not…"
976,Rhodey,You don’t have to do that. I heard the whole thing.
977,Tony,You should get lost.
978,Rhodey,I was here first. Get a roof.
979,Tony,I thought you were out of one-liners.
980,Rhodey,That’s the last one.
981,Tony,"You kicked ass back there, by the way."
982,Rhodey,"Thank you. You too. Listen, my car got taken out in the explosion, so I’m gonna have to hang on to your suit for a minute, okay?"
983,Tony,Not okay. Not okay with that.
984,Rhodey,It wasn’t a question.
985,Tony,How are you gonna resign if I don’t accept?
986,Fury,"I don’t think I want you looking at that. I’m not sure it pertains to you anymore. Now this on the other hand, is Agent Romanoff’s assessment of you. Read it."
987,Tony,"“Personality overview. Mr Stark displays compulsive behaviour.” In my own defence, that was last week. “Prone to self-destructive tendencies.” I was dying. I mean, please. Aren’t we all? “Textbook narcissism”? Agreed. Okay, here it is. “Recruitment assessment for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes.” I gotta think about it."
988,Fury,Read on.
989,Tony,“Tony Stark not… Not recommended”? That doesn’t make any sense. How can you approve me but not approve me? I got a new ticker. I’m trying to do right by Pepper. I’m in a stable-ish relationship.
990,Fury,Which leads us to believe at this juncture we’d only like to use you as a consultant.
991,Tony,"Then again, I will waive my customary retainer in exchange for a small favour. Rhodey and I are being honoured in Washington and we need a presenter."
992,Fury,I’ll see what I can do.
993,Stern,"It is my honour to be here today to present these distinguished awards to Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes and Mr Tony Stark, who is, of course, a national treasure.  Thank you Lieutenant Colonel, for such and exceptionally distinguished performance. You deserve this."
994,Rhodey,Thank you sir.
995,Stern,"Mr Stark. Thank you for such as exceptionally distinguished performance. You deserve this.  Oh, sorry. Funny how annoying a little prick can be, isn’t it? Let’s get a photo."
996,Agent Coulson,"Sir, we’ve found it."
0,Tony Stark,"We create our own demons. Who said that? What does that even mean? Doesn't matter, I said it cause he said it. So now he was famous and that's basically get said by two well known guys. I don't, uh..."
1,Tony Stark,I'm gonna start again. Let's track this from the beginning.
2,Happy Hogan,Half hour till the ball drops.
3,Tony Stark,"Hey, do you want...?"
4,Party Guest,"Tony Stark? Great speech, man!"
5,Happy Hogan,"I got you, pal."
6,Tony Stark,I gave a speech? How was it?
7,Happy Hogan,Pitiful
8,Maya Hansen,Unintelligible.
9,Tony Stark,Really?
10,Maya Hansen,Mmm-hmm.
11,Tony Stark,"It's my favorite kind, a winning combo."
12,Maya Hansen,Where are we going?
13,Tony Stark,"Uh, to town on each other, probably back in your room. Cause I also wanna see your research."
14,Maya Hansen,"Okay, you can see my research, but that's...I'm not gonna show you my ""town."""
15,Ho Yinsen,Mr. Stark
16,Tony Stark,"Oh, I finally met a man called ""Ho."""
17,Ho Yinsen,"I would like to introduce you to our guest, Dr. Wu."
18,Tony Stark,"Oh, this guy."
19,Ho Yinsen,Mr. Stark.
20,Tony Stark,Hey.
21,Maya Hansen,Bye.
22,Ho Yinsen,Perhaps another time.
23,Tony Stark,"It started in Bern, Switzerland, 1999."
24,Aldrich Killian,Mr. Stark!
25,Tony Stark,I never thought they'd come back to bite me. Why would they?
26,Aldrich Killian,"Oh, wow! Hey, Tony! Aldrich Killian.  I'm a big fan of your work!"
27,Maya Hansen,My work?
28,Tony Stark,Who isn't? He means me.
29,Aldrich Killian,"Well, of course. But, Miss Hansen, my organization has been tracking your research since year two of MIT."
30,Happy Hogan,"Yeah, we're full."
31,Tony Stark,"Oh, wow. He made it. He made the cut."
32,Happy Hogan,"What floor are you going to, pal?"
33,Aldrich Killian,"Oh, now, that is an appropriate question. The ground floor, actually. I've got a proposal I'm putting together with myself. It's a privately funded think tank called, Advanced Idea Mechanics."
34,Tony Stark,Uh... she'll take both.
35,Maya Hansen,Okay.
36,Tony Stark,One to throw away and one to not call.
37,Aldrich Killian,"Advanced Idea Mechanics, or AIM for short.  Do you get it?"
38,Tony Stark,"I see that, cause it's on your t-shirt."
39,Aldrich Killian,Aw!
40,Tony Stark,Ladies first.
41,Maya Hansen,"Thank you, I'll call you."
42,Tony Stark,I'm titillated by the notion of working with you.
43,Aldrich Killian,Yeah?
44,Tony Stark,"Yeah, cheese clown. I'll see you up on the roof in five minutes.  I'm just going to try to get my beef wet real quick. You know what I'm talkin' about?"
45,Aldrich Killian,I'll see you up there.
46,Tony Stark,Damn betcha.
47,Tony Stark,Come on! I thought that was just a theory.
48,Maya Hansen,"Well, it was. If I'm right, we can access the area of the brain that governs repair..."
49,Tony Stark,Wow.
50,Maya Hansen,...And chemically recode it.
51,Tony Stark,That's incredible. Essentially you're hacking into the genetic...
52,Both,...Genetic operating system...
53,Tony Stark,...of a...
54,Maya Hansen,Exactly.
55,Tony,...living organism.
56,Maya Hansen,Yes.
57,Tony Stark,Wow.
58,Maya Hansen,Is that... Can you...
59,Happy Hogan,What?
60,Maya Hansen,Can you not touch my plant. It's not...she doesn't like it. She prefers...
61,Tony Stark,She's not like the others.​​​​​​  Come on. Let's go in the bedroom. Happy...
62,Maya Hansen,"That's cute, but..."
63,Tony Stark,Leave her ficus alone.
64,Maya Hansen,
65,Tony Stark,And you're starting with plants?
66,Maya Hansen,"For now, yeah."
67,Tony Stark,Huh.
68,Maya Hansen,I'm calling it Extremis.
69,Maya Hansen,"Well, it's..."
70,Both,Human application.
71,Maya Hansen,Exactly! Exactly.
72,Maya Hansen,Dendritic revitalization.
73,Tony Stark,It's revolutionary.
74,Maya Hansen,Disease prevention...
75,Tony Stark,Changes the world.
76,Maya Hansen,...even limb regrowth.
77,Tony Stark,You're the most gifted woman I've ever met.
78,Maya Hansen,Wow.
79,Tony Stark,In Switzerland.
80,Maya Hansen,"Hmm, that's better. Aw, you're seeing things."
81,Tony,This week.
82,Tony Stark,"You almost bought it, didn't you?"
83,Maya Hansen,"This is what I'm talking about, the glitch."
84,Tony Stark,Have you checked the telomerase algorithm?
85,Maya Hansen,The what?
86,Happy Hogan,"Down! Stay down! Stay down, boss."
87,Tony Stark,We're good.
88,Happy Hogan,Stay down.
89,Tony Stark,You're...you're right on me. I made it.  What the hell was that?
90,Happy Hogan,What was that?
91,Maya Hansen,It's a glitch in my work. It's...
92,Tony Stark,She was just talking about it. Glitches happening.
93,Happy Hogan,It's not Y2K.
94,Maya Hansen,No.
95,Tony Stark,Hey!
96,Happy Hogan,Happy New Year.
97,Tony Stark,Happy New Year.
98,Maya Hansen,Happy New Year.
99,Tony Stark,"Alright, I'll see you in the morning, goodnight."
100,Happy Hogan,You good?
101,Tony Stark,Yep.
102,Happy Hogan,I'll be right outside.
103,Tony Stark,Okay.
104,Tony Stark,"So why am I telling you this? Because I had just created demons, and I didn't even know it."
105,Tony Stark,"Yeah, those were the good times. Then I moved on. After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave, I said goodbye to the party scene. Forgot that night in Switzerland. These days I'm a changed man, I'm different now. I'm well... you know who I am."
106,Tony Stark,Ow!
107,JARVIS,"Sir, please may I request just a few hours to calibrate..."
108,Tony Stark,No. Forty-eight.  Ah! Micro-repeater implanting sequence complete.
109,JARVIS,"As you wish, sir. I've also prepared a safety briefing for you to entirely ignore."
110,Tony Stark,"Which I will. Right, let's do this."
111,Tony Stark,"Dummy. Hi, Dummy. How did you get that cap on your head? You earned it."
112,Tony Stark,"Hey. Hey! What are you doing round in the corner? You know what you did. Blood on my mat, handle it."
113,JARVIS,"Sir, may I remind you that you've been awake for nearly seventy-two hours."
114,Tony Stark,"Focus up, ladies. Good evening, and welcome to the birthing suite. I'm pleased to announce the imminent arrival of your bouncing, bad-ass, baby brother."
115,Tony Stark,"Start tight and go wide, stamp in time. Mark 42 autonomous prehensile propulsion suit test. Initialize sequence."
116,Tony Stark,"Jarvis, drop my needle."
117,Tony Stark,Crap.
118,Tony Stark,"Alright, I think we got this. Send 'em all."
119,Tony Stark,"Probably a little fast, slow it down. Slow it down just a..."
120,Tony Stark,...little bit.
121,Tony Stark,"Cool it, will you, Jarvis?"
122,Tony Stark,Come on. I ain't scared of you.
123,Tony Stark,I'm the best.
124,JARVIS,"As always, sir, a great pleasure watching you work."
125,Tony Stark,And I guess seventy-two hours isn't a long time between siesta's. Didn't think it could get any worse. Then I had to go and turn on the TV.
126,Tony Stark,That's when he happened.
127,The Mandarin,"Some people call me a terrorist, I consider myself a teacher. America, ready for another lesson. In 1864 in Sand Creek Colorado the U.S. military waited till the friendly Cheyenne braves all gone hunting, waited to attack and slaughter their families left behind, and claim their land. Thirty-nine hours ago the Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait was attacked. I...I...I did that. A quaint military church filled with wives and children, of course. The soldiers were out on maneuvers, the braves were away. President Ellis, you continue to resist my attempts to educate you, sir. And now, you've missed me again. You know who I am, you don't know where I am, and you'll never see me coming."
128,News Reporter #1,"And now that we seem to be back, let's recap some of the frightening..."
129,News Reporter #2,American Airwaves were highjacked...
130,News Reporter #3,The nation remains on high alert...
131,News Reporter #4,All attempts to find the Mandarin have so far proved unsuccessful...
132,President Ellis,"Central to my Administration's response to this terrorist event, is a newly minted resource. I know him as Colonel James Rhodes, the American people will soon know him as the Iron Patriot."
133,Bill Maher,And how is President Ellis responding? By taking the guy they call War Machine and giving him a paint job.
134,Joan Rivers,"Same suit, but painted red, white, and blue. Look at rhat. And they also renamed him Iron Patriot. You know, just in case the paint was too subtle."
135,Colonel James Rhodes,"It tested well with focus groups, alright?"
136,Tony Stark,I am Iron Patriot...
137,Colonel James Rhodes,"Listen, War Machine was a little too aggressive, alright? This sends a better message."
138,Tony Stark,"So what's really goin' on? With Mandarin. Seriously, can we talk about this guy?"
139,Colonel James Rhodes,"It's classified information, Tony. Okay, there have been nine bombings."
140,Tony Stark,Nine.
141,Colonel James Rhodes,"The public only knows about three. Here's the thing, nobody can ID a device. There's no bomb casings."
142,Tony Stark,"You know I can help, just ask. I got a ton of new tech, I got a prehensile, I got a...I got a new bomb disposal. Catches explosions mid-air."
143,Colonel James Rhodes,When's the last time you got a good night's sleep?
144,Tony Stark,Einstein slept three hours a year. Look what he did?
145,Colonel James Rhodes,"People are concerned about you, Tony. I'm concerned about you."
146,Tony Stark,You're gonna come at me like that?
147,Colonel James Rhodes,"No. No, look, I'm not trying to be a dic..."
148,Colonel James Rhodes,...tator.
149,Erin,Do you mind signing my drawing?
150,Tony Stark,"If Richard doesn't mind.  You alright with this, Dick?"
151,Colonel James Rhodes,Fine with me.
152,Tony Stark,What's your name?
153,Erin,Erin.
154,Tony Stark,"I loved you in A Christmas Story, by the way."
155,Colonel James Rhodes,"Listen, the Pentagon is scared. After what happened in New York... aliens, come on. They need to look strong. Stopping the Mandarin is priority, but it's not..."
156,Tony Stark,"It's not superhero business, I get it."
157,Colonel James Rhodes,"No, it's not, quite frankly. It's American business."
158,Tony Stark,That's why I said I...got it.
159,Colonel James Rhodes,Are you okay?
160,Tony Stark,I broke the crayon.
161,Erin,"Are you okay, Mr. Stark?"
162,Colonel James Rhodes,Take it easy. Tony...
163,Little Boy,How did you get out of the wormhole? How did you get out of the wormhole?
164,Colonel James Rhodes,Wait a minute! Tony!
165,Tony Stark,What'd he say?!
166,Colonel James Rhodes,Tony!
167,Tony Stark,Sorry. Have to check on the suit...make sure...okay.
168,Tony Stark,"Check the heart, check the...check the...is it the brain?"
169,JARVIS,No sign of cardiac analomy or unusual brain activity.
170,Tony Stark,"Okay, so I was poisoned?"
171,Jarvis,My diagnosis is that you've experienced a severe anxiety attack.
172,Tony Stark,Me?
173,Colonel James Rhodes,"Come on, man. This isn't a good look, open up."
174,Tony Stark,"Sorry, I gotta split."
175,Happy Hogan,"Badge. Badge. Come on, badge. Badge, guys. I put a memo in the toilet, come on.  Tony has got them in his basement, they're wearing party hats. This is an asset that we can put to use."
176,Pepper Potts,"Uh-huh. So, you're suggesting that I replace the entire janitorial staff with robots?"
177,Happy Hogan,What I'm saying is that the human element of Human Resources is our biggest point of vulnerability. We should start phasing it out immediately.
178,Pepper Potts,What!?
179,Happy Hogan,"Excuse me, Bambi."
180,Pepper Potts,Did you just say that?
181,Happy Hogan,Security.
182,Pepper Potts,Happy?
183,Happy Hogan,Yes.
184,Pepper Potts,"Okay, I am thrilled that you're now the Head of Security, okay? It is the perfect position for you."
185,Happy Hogan,Thank you.
186,Pepper Potts,However...
187,Happy Hogan,I do appreciate it
188,Pepper Potts,Since you've taken the post...
189,Happy Hogan,You don't have to thank me.
190,Pepper Potts,We've had a rise in staff complaints of three hundred percent
191,Happy Hogan,Thank you.
192,Pepper Potts,That's not a compliment.
193,Happy Hogan,That's not a compli...? It is a compliment! Clearly somebody's trying to hide something.
194,Pepper Potts,I...
195,Pepper's Assistant,Excuse me.
196,Pepper Potts,Yes?
197,Pepper's Assistant,"Miss Potts, your four o'clock is here."
198,Pepper Potts,Thank you.
199,Happy Hogan,Did you clear this four o'clock with me?
200,Pepper Potts,"Happy, we'll talk about this later. But right now I have to go deal with this very annoying thing."
201,Happy Hogan,How so?
202,Pepper Potts,"I used to work with him, and he used to ask me out all the time. So it's a little awkward."
203,Happy Hogan,I don't like the sound of that.
204,Aldrich Killian,Pepper.
205,Pepper Potts,Killian?
206,Aldrich Killian,You look great. You look really great.
207,Pepper Potts,"God, you look...you look great. I... I...I can't... What on earth have you been doing?"
208,Aldrich Killian,"Nothing fancy, just five years in the hands of physical therapists. And please, call me Aldrich."
209,Happy Hogan,Uh...you were supposed to be issued a security badge.
210,Pepper Potts,"Happy, it's okay."
211,Happy Hogan,Yes?
212,Pepper Potts,We're good.
213,Happy Hogan,You sure?
214,Pepper Potts,Yes. Stand down.
215,Happy Hogan,"Okay. I'm gonna linger, right here."
216,Pepper Potts,Thank you.
217,Happy Hogan,Okay.
218,Pepper Potts,"It's very nice to see you, Killian."
219,Happy Hogan,"Hey, guy."
220,Savin,Merry Christmas.
221,Aldrich Killian,"After years dodging the President's ban on ""immoral biotech research"", my think tank now has a little something in the pipeline. It's an idea we like to call Extremis. I'm gonna turn your lights down."
222,Aldrich Killian,Regard the human brain.
223,Aldrich Killian,"Uh...wait. Hold on, hold on. That's...that's the universe, my bad. But if I do that..."
224,Aldrich Killian,"That's the brain. Strangely mimetic though, wouldn't you say?"
225,Aldrich Killian,"Thanks, it's mine."
226,Pepper Potts,What?
227,Aldrich Killian,This...you're inside my head. It's a...
228,Aldrich Killian,"It's a live feed. Come on up, I'll prove it to you."
229,Aldrich Killian,Come on.
230,Aldrich Killian,"Now, pinch my arm. I can take it. Pinch me."
231,Pepper Potts,What is that?
232,Aldrich Killian,It's the primary somatosensory cortex. It's the brain's pain center. But this is what I wanted to show you.
233,Aldrich Killian,"Now, Extremis harnesses our bioelectrical potential and it goes...here. This is essentially an empty slot, and what this tells us is that our mind, our entire DNA in fact, is destined to be upgraded."
234,Pepper Potts,Wow.
235,Happy Hogan,Hello?
236,Tony Stark,Is this forehead of Security?
237,Happy Hogan,"What? You know, look, I got a real job. What do you want? I'm working, I got something going on here."
238,Tony Stark,What? Harassing interns?
239,Happy Hogan,"Let me tell you something, you know what happened when I told people I was Iron Man's body guard? They would laugh in my face."
240,Happy Hogan,"I had to leave while I still had a shred of dignity. Now I got a real job, I'm watching Pepper."
241,Tony Stark,What's going on? Fill me in.
242,Happy Hogan,For real?
243,Tony Stark,Yeah.
244,Happy Hogan,"Alright, so she's meeting up with this scientist. Rich guy, handsome."
245,Tony Stark,Right.
246,Happy Hogan,"I couldn't make his face at first, right? You know I'm good with faces."
247,Tony Stark,"Oh, Yeah, yeah. You're the best."
248,Happy Hogan,"Yeah. Well, so I run his credentials, I make him Aldrich Killian. We actually met the guy back in... where were we in '99? The science conference?"
249,Tony Stark,Um...Switzerland.
250,Happy Hogan,"Right, right, exactly."
251,Tony Stark,"Killian? No, I don't remember that guy."
252,Happy Hogan,"Of course you don't. He's not a blond with a big rack. At first it was fine, they were talking business, but now it's like getting weird. He's showing her a big brain."
253,Tony Stark,His what?
254,Happy Hogan,"Big brain, and she likes it. Here, let me show you. Hold on. See?"
255,Tony Stark,Look at what? You watching them? Flip the screen and then we can get started.
256,Happy Hogan,"I'm not a tech genius like you. Just...just trust me, get down down here."
257,Tony Stark,"Flip the screen, then I can see what they're doing."
258,Happy Hogan,I can't! I don't know how to flip the screen! Don't talk to me like that anymore. You're not my boss.
259,Happy Hogan,"Alright, I don't work for you. Now I don't trust this guy. He's got another guy with him, he's shifty."
260,Tony Stark,Relax.
261,Happy Hogan,Seriously?
262,Tony Stark,I'm just asking you to secure the perimeter. Tell him to go out for a drink or something?
263,Happy Hogan,"You know what? You should take more of an interest in what's going on here. This woman... this woman's the best thing that ever happened to you, and you...you're just ignoring her."
264,Tony Stark,A giant brain?
265,Happy Hogan,"Yeah, there's a giant brain, there's a shifty character. I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna run his plates and if it gets rough, so be it."
266,Tony Stark,"I miss you, Happy."
267,Happy Hogan,"Yeah, I miss you too. But the way it used to be. Now you're off with the 'superfriends', I don't know what's going on with you anymore. The world's getting weird..."
268,Tony Stark,"Hey, I...I'd hate to cut you off. Do you have your taser on you?"
269,Happy Hogan,Why?
270,Tony Stark,"I think there's a gal in HR who's trying to steal some printer ink, you should probably go over there and zap her."
271,Happy Hogan,"Yeah, nice."
272,Aldrich Killian,Imagine if you could hack into the hard drive of any living organism and recode its DNA.
273,Pepper Potts,It would be incredible.
274,Aldrich Killian,Mm.
275,Pepper Potts,"Unfortunately, to my ears it also sounds highly weaponizable. As in enhanced soldiers, private armies, and Tony is not..."
276,Aldrich Killian,"Tony. Tony. You know, I invited Tony to join AIM thirteen years ago, he turned me down. But something tells me now there is a new genius on the throne who doesn't have to answer to Tony anymore, and who has slightly less of an ego."
277,Pepper Potts,"It's gonna be a no, Aldrich. As much as I'd like to help you."
278,Aldrich Killian,"Well, I can't say that I'm not disappointed. But then as my father used to say, 'Failure is the fog through which we glimpse triumph.'"
279,Pepper Potts,That's very deep.
280,Aldrich Killian,Mm
281,Pepper Potts,And I have no idea what it means.
282,Aldrich Killian,"Well, me neither. He was kind of an idiot, my old man."
283,Aldrich Killian,"I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper."
284,Pepper Potts,Happy...
285,Happy Hogan,"The car is ready, if you're ready to go."
286,Pepper Potts,"Yes. I just um... God, I forgot my... other thing, so... I'm just gonna..."
287,Pepper Potts,I'm sorry I'm late. I was... What the...? What is that?!
288,Pepper Potts,"You're wearing this in the house now? What is that, like Mark 15?"
289,Tony Stark,Uh...yeah. Something like that. You know everybody needs a hobby.
290,Pepper Potts,"Oh, and you have to wear your hobby in the living room?"
291,Tony Stark,"Just breakin' it in. You know, it's always a little pinchy in the gooey bag at first, so."
292,Tony Stark,"Oh hey, did you see your Christmas present?"
293,Pepper Potts,"Yes, I did. I...I don't know how I could have missed that Christmas present. Is it gonna fit through the door?"
294,Tony Stark,"Well actually, uh...it's a good question. I got a team of guys comin' tomorrow, they're gonna blow out that wall."
295,Pepper Potts,Okay.
296,Tony Stark,"So, uh...tense? Good day?"
297,Tony Stark,"Ooh shoulders, a little naughty. Naughty girl. I don't wanna harp on this, but did you like the custom rabbit?"
298,Pepper Potts,Did I like it?
299,Tony Stark,"Nailed it, right?"
300,Pepper Potts,Wow. I appreciate the thought very much.
301,Pepper Potts,So why don't you lift up that face mask and give me a kiss?
302,Tony Stark,"Huh. Yup, dammit. No can do. You wanna just kiss it on the..."
303,Pepper Potts,Uh-huh.
304,Tony Stark,The facial slit?
305,Pepper Potts,"Well, why don't I run down to the garage and see if I can't find a crowbar to shimmy that thing open?"
306,Tony Stark,Crowbar. Yeah.
307,Tony Stark,"Oh, except there's been a...uh...a radiation leak."
308,Pepper Potts,I'll take my chances.
309,Tony Stark,That's risky.
310,Tony Stark,At least let me get you like a Hazmat suit or a Geiger counter or something like that.
311,Tony Stark,Busted.
312,Pepper Potts,This is a new level of lame.
313,Tony Stark,Sorry.
314,Pepper Potts,"You ate without me, already? On date night?"
315,Tony Stark,He was just...
316,Pepper Potts,You mean you?
317,Tony Stark,"Well, yeah. I just mean we were just...just hosting you while I finished up a little work."
318,Pepper Potts,Uh-huh.
319,Tony Stark,"And yes, I had a quick bite. I didn't know if you were comin' home or if you were having drinks with Aldrich Killian."
320,Pepper Potts,What?
321,Tony Stark,What?
322,Pepper Potts,Aldrich Killian? What are you checking up on me?
323,Tony Stark,Happy was concerned.
324,Pepper Potts,"No, you're spying on me."
325,Tony Stark,I wasn't...
326,Pepper Potts,I'm going to bed.
327,Tony Stark,Hold on. Come on. Pep.
328,Tony Stark,"Hey, I admit it! My fault. Sorry."
329,Tony Stark,"I'm a piping hot mess. It's been going on for a while, I haven't said anything."
330,Tony Stark,Nothing's been the same since New York.
331,Pepper Potts,"Oh really? Well, I didn't notice that, at all."
332,Tony Stark,"You experience things and then they're over and you still can't explain 'em. Gods, aliens, other dimensions. I...I'm just a man in a can. The only reason I haven't cracked up is probably because you moved in. Which is great. I love you, I'm lucky. But, honey, I can't sleep. You go to bed, I come down here. I do what I know, I tinker."
333,Tony Stark,"But threat is imminent, and I have to protect the one thing that I can't live without. That's you. My suits, they're uh..."
334,Pepper Potts,Machines.
335,Tony Stark,They're part of me.
336,Pepper Potts,A distraction.
337,Tony Stark,Maybe.
338,Pepper Potts,I'm gonna take a shower.
339,Tony Stark,Okay.
340,Pepper Potts,And you're gonna join me.
341,Tony Stark,Better.
342,Pepper Potts,Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony...
343,Tony Stark,Power down!
344,Tony Stark,"I must have called it in my sleep. That's not supposed to happen. I'll recalibrate the sensors. Can we just...just let me...just let me catch my breath, okay?"
345,Tony Stark,"Don't go, alright? Pepper?"
346,Pepper Potts,I'm going to sleep downstairs. Tinker with that.
347,Savin,Can you regulate?
348,Taggert,"Yes, I can regulate."
349,Savin,Are you sure about that?
350,Taggert,Yes.
351,Savin,It's a decent batch. Don't say I never did nothin' for you.
352,Taggert,Thank you...I mean for understanding.
353,Happy Hogan,"I'm sorry, buddy."
354,Savin,"What are you doin', buddy? You out by yourself? A little date night? Watching your favorite chick flick maybe?"
355,Happy Hogan,"Yeah, a little movie called ""The Party's Over"", starring you and your junkie girlfriend, and here's the ticket."
356,Savin,No kidding? That doesn't belong to you.
357,Taggert,Savin!
358,Savin,What?
359,Taggert,Help! Help me!
360,The Mandarin,"True story about fortune cookies. They look Chinese, they sound Chinese, but they're actually an American invention. Which is why they're hollow, full of lies, and leave a bad taste in the mouth. My disciples just destroyed another cheap American knock-off, The Chinese Theater. Mr. President, I know this must be getting frustrating, but this season of terror is drawing to a close. And don't worry, the big one is coming; your graduation."
361,Tony Stark,Hi.
362,Happy's Nurse,Oh.
363,Tony Stark,Uh...mind leaving that on?
364,Happy's Nurse,Sure.
365,Tony Stark,"Sunday night's PBS 'Downtown Abbey'. That's his show, he thinks it's elegant."
366,Hospital News Reporter,We're awaiting the arrival of Tony Stark. We're hoping he'll give us the reaction...his reaction to the latest attack.
367,Pushy Tabloid Reporter,"Hey, Mr. Stark! When is somebody gonna kill this guy? Just sayin'."
368,Tony Stark,"Is that what you want? Here's a little Holiday greeting I've been wanting to send to the Mandarin. I just didn't know how to phrase it until now. My name is Tony Stark and I'm not afraid of you. I know you're a coward, so I've decided"
369,JARVIS,"I've compiled a Mandarin database for you, sir. Drawn from S.H.I.E.L.D., F.B.I., and C.I.A. intercepts. Initiating virtual crime scene reconstruction."
370,Tony Stark,"Okay, what do we got here? His name is an ancient Chinese war mantle, meaning ""adviser to the King"". South American insurgency tactics, talks like a Baptist preacher. There's lots of pageantry going on here...lots of theater."
371,JARVIS,The heat from the blast was in excess of 3000 degrees Celsius. Any subjects within 12.5 yards were vaporized instantly.
372,Tony Stark,No bomb parts found in a three mile radius of the Chinese theater.
373,JARVIS,"No, sir."
374,Tony Stark,"Talk to me, Happy.  Any military victims?"
375,JARVIS,"Not according to public records, sir."
376,Tony Stark,"Bring up the thermogenic signatures again, factor in three thousand degrees."
377,JARVIS,The oracle cloud has completed analysis. Accessing satellites and plotting the last twelve months of thermogenic occurrence now.
378,Tony Stark,Take away everywhere that there's been a Mandarin attack.  That. You sure that's not one of his?
379,JARVIS,It predates any known Mandarin attack. The incident was the use of a bomb to assist a suicide.
380,Tony Stark,Bring her around.
381,JARVIS,The heat signature is remarkably similar. Three thousand degrees Celsius.
382,Tony Stark,"That's two military guys. Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?"
383,JARVIS,Creating a flight plan for Tennessee.
384,Tony Stark,"Are we still at ""ding-dong""? We're supposed to be on total security lock down. Come on, I threatened a terrorist. Who is that?"
385,JARVIS,"There's only so much I can do, sir, when you give the world's press your home address."
386,Tony Stark,"Right there's fine.  You're not the Mandarin, are you? Are you?"
387,Maya Hansen,You don't remember. Why am I not surprised?
388,Tony Stark,"Don't take it personally, I don't remember what I had for breakfast."
389,JARVIS,"Gluten-free waffles, sir."
390,Tony Stark,That's right.
391,Maya Hansen,"Okay, look, I need to be alone with you. Someplace not here, it's urgent."
392,Tony Stark,"Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing, but now I'm in a committed relationship.  It's...with her."
393,Pepper Potts,"Tony, is somebody there?"
394,Tony Stark,"Yeah, it's Maya Hansen.  Please don't tell me that there is a twelve year-old kid waiting in the car that I've never met."
395,Maya Hansen,"He's thirteen. And no, I need your help."
396,Tony Stark,What...what for? Why now?
397,Maya Hansen,"Because I read the papers, and, frankly, I don't think you'll last the week."
398,Tony Stark,I'll be fine.
399,Pepper Potts,"I'm sorry. With Happy in the hospital, I didn't know we were expecting guests."
400,Tony Stark,We weren't.
401,Maya Hansen,"No, I..."
402,Pepper Potts,And old girlfriends!
403,Tony Stark,She's not really.
404,Maya Hansen,"No, not really. It...it was just one night."
405,Tony Stark,Yep.
406,Pepper Potts,"That's how you did it, isn't it? Yep."
407,Tony Stark,It was a great night.
408,Pepper Potts,"Well, you know..."
409,Maya Hansen,Yeah.
410,Pepper Potts,You have saved yourself a world of pain.
411,Maya Hansen,I'm sure.
412,Tony Stark,What?
413,Pepper Potts,Trust me.  We're going out of town.
414,Tony Stark,"Okay, we've been through this. Nope."
415,Pepper Potts,Yep!
416,Tony Stark,The man says no.
417,Pepper Potts,Immediately and indefinitely!
418,Tony Stark,Honey...
419,Maya Hansen,Great idea. Let's go.
420,Tony Stark,I'm sorry. That's a terrible idea. Please don't touch her bags.
421,Pepper Potts,"Tony, this is how normal people behave."
422,Tony Stark,I can't protect you out there. I challenged...
423,Maya Hansen,Is...is that normal?
424,Tony Stark,"Yes, this is normal!"
425,Pepper Potts,"Sadly, that...is very normal."
426,Tony Stark,"It's a big bunny, relax about it!"
427,Pepper Potts,Calm down!
428,Tony Stark,I got this for you.
429,Pepper Potts,I'm aware of that.
430,Tony Stark,You still haven't even told me that you liked it!
431,Pepper Potts,I don't like it!
432,Tony Stark,I asked you three... You don't like it?!
433,Pepper Potts,"Tony, we are leaving the house; that's not even up for discussion."
434,Tony Stark,I said no.
435,Maya Hansen,"Guys, can we um..."
436,Tony Stark,What?
437,Maya Hansen,
438,Pepper Potts,I got you.
439,Tony Stark,"I got you first. Like I said, we can't stay here."
440,Pepper Potts,Oh my God. Tony!
441,JARVIS,"Sir, Miss Potts is clear of the structure."
442,Tony Stark,"Jarvis, where's my flight power?!"
443,JARVIS,"Working on it, sir. This is a prototype."
444,Tony Stark,That's one.
445,JARVIS,"Sir, the suit is not combat-ready."
446,Tony Stark,That's two.
447,Pepper Potts,Tony!
448,JARVIS,"Sir, take a deep breath."
449,JARVIS,Sir. Sir!
450,Tony Stark,"Alright, kill the alarm. I got it."
451,JARVIS,That's the emergency alert triggered by the power dropping below five percent.
452,Tony Stark,"It's snowing, right? Where are we, upstate?"
453,JARVIS,"We're five miles outside of Rose Hills, Tennessee."
454,Tony Stark,"Why?! Jarvis! Not my idea! What are we doing here? This is thousands of miles away, I gotta get Pepper, I gotta..."
455,JARVIS,I prepared a flight plan. This was the location.
456,Tony Stark,Who asked you? Open the suit.
457,JARVIS,"I...I think I may be malfunctioning, sir."
458,Tony Stark,Open eject.  Maybe I'll just cozy back up for a bit.
459,JARVIS,"I actually think I need to sleep now, sir."
460,Tony Stark,"Jarvis. Jarvis? Don't leave me, buddy."
461,Computer Voice,Stark Secure Server: Now transferring to all known receivers.
462,Tony Stark,"Pepper, it's me. I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way. That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again. Also, it's Christmas time, the rabbit's too big. Done. Sorry. And I'm sorry in advance because...I can't come home yet. I need to find this guy. You gotta stay safe. That's all I know. I just stole a poncho from a wooden Indian."
463,Harley Keener,Freeze! Don't move.
464,Tony Stark,"You got me. Nice potato gun. Barrel's a little long. Between that and the wide gauge, it's gonna diminish your FPS.  And now you're out of ammo."
465,Harley Keener,What's that thing on your chest?
466,Tony Stark,"It's a electromagnet. You should know, you've got a box of them right here."
467,Harley Keener,What does it power?  Oh my god! That... that's... Is that Iron Man?
468,Tony Stark,"Technically, I am."
469,Harley Keener,"Technically, you're dead."
470,Tony Stark,A valid point.
471,Harley Keener,What happened to him?
472,Tony Stark,"Life. I built him, I take care of him, I'll fix him."
473,Harley Keener,Like a mechanic?
474,Tony Stark,Yeah.
475,Harley Keener,Oh. If I was building Iron Man and War Machine.
476,Tony Stark,It's Iron Patriot now.
477,Harley Keener,That's way cooler!
478,Tony Stark,"No, it's not."
479,Harley Keener,"Anyways, I would have added in um... the retro..."
480,Tony Stark,Retroreflective panels?
481,Harley Keener,To make him stealth mode.
482,Tony Stark,You want a stealth mode?
483,Harley Keener,"Cool, right?"
484,Tony Stark,That's actually a good idea. Maybe I'll build one.
485,Harley Keener,Oops!
486,Tony Stark,"Not a good idea! What are you doing? You're gonna break his finger? He's in pain, he's been injured. Leave him alone."
487,Harley Keener,S...Sorry.
488,Tony Stark,"Are you? Don't worry about it, I'll fix it. So, uh, who's home?"
489,Harley Keener,"Well, my mom already left for the diner and dad went to 7-Eleven to get scratchers. I... I guess he won, 'cause that was six years ago."
490,Tony Stark,"Mm. Which happens, dads leave. No need to be a pussy about it. Here's what I need: a laptop, a digital watch, a cell phone, the pneumatic actuator from your bazooka over there, a map of town, a big spring, and a tuna fish sandwich."
491,Harley Keener,What's in it for me?
492,Tony Stark,Salvation. What's his name?
493,Harley Keener,Who?
494,Tony Stark,"The kid that bullies you at school, what's his name?"
495,Harley Keener,How'd you know that?
496,Tony Stark,I got just the thing.  Deal? Deal? What'd you say?
497,Harley Keener,Deal.
498,Tony Stark,Deal?  What's you're name?
499,Harley Keener,Harley. And you're...
500,Tony Stark,The mechanic. Tony
501,Computer Voice,Stark Secure Server. Retinal scan: Verified.
502,Tony Stark,"Pepper, it's me.  I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way. That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again."
503,Pepper Potts,Why were you at the house tonight? What was so important that you had to speak to Tony?
504,Maya Hansen,"I think that my boss is working for the Mandarin. So if you still want to talk about it, I suggest that we get ourselves someplace safe."
505,Pepper Potts,"Your boss works for the Mandarin, you think? But Tony says you're a botanist, so..."
506,Maya Hansen,"That figures. What I actually am is a biological DNA coder running a team of forty out of a privately-funded think tank, but sure you can call me a botanist."
507,Pepper Potts,"This boss of yours, does he have a name?"
508,Maya Hansen,"Yeah, Aldrich Killian."
509,Savin,"Well, we took the house down, sir..."
510,Aldrich Killian,Mmhmm.
511,Savin,But there's no sign of a body.
512,Aldrich Killian,I see.
513,Savin,No Stark.
514,Aldrich Killian,"I have to go.  Alright everybody. No talking and no eye contact, unless you wanna get shot in the face."
515,Mandarin Look-Out,The Master is travelling.
516,The Mandarin,Well then. What are we waiting for?
517,Tony Stark,"The sandwich was fair, the spring was a little rusty, the rest of the materials, I'll make do. By the way, when you said your sister had a watch, I was kinda hoping for something a little more than that."
518,Harley Keener,"She's six! Anyway, it's limited edition. When can we talk about New York?"
519,Tony Stark,"Maybe never, relax about it."
520,Harley Keener,"What about The Avengers, can you talk about them?"
521,Tony Stark,"I don't know, later. Hey kid, give me a little space.  What's the official story here? What happened?"
522,Harley Keener,"I guess this guy named Chad Davis, used to live roundabouts, won a bunch of medals in the army. One day, folks said he went crazy and made, you know, a bomb. Then he blew himself up right here."
523,Tony Stark,"Six people died, right?"
524,Harley Keener,Yeah.
525,Tony Stark,Including Chad Davis?
526,Harley Keener,Yeah.
527,Tony Stark,"Yeah. That doesn't make sense.  Think about it. Six dead, only five shadows."
528,Harley Keener,"Yeah, people said these shadows are like the mark of souls gone to Heaven. Except the bomb guy, he went to Hell on account of he didn't get a shadow. That's why there's only five."
529,Tony Stark,Do you buy that?
530,Harley Keener,That's what everyone says. You know what this crater reminds me of?
531,Tony Stark,No idea. I'm not...I don't care.
532,Harley Keener,"That giant wormhole, in um...in New York. Does it remind you?"
533,Tony Stark,That's manipulative. I don't want to talk about it.
534,Harley Keener,Are they coming back? The aliens?
535,Tony Stark,"Maybe. Can you stop? Remember when I told you, that I have an anxiety issue?"
536,Harley Keener,Does this subject make you...make you edgy?
537,Tony Stark,"Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch my breath for a second?"
538,Harley Keener,Are there bad guys in Rose Hills? Do you...do you need a plastic bag to breathe into? Do you have medication?
539,Tony Stark,Nope.
540,Harley Keener,Do you need to be on it?
541,Tony Stark,Probably.
542,Harley Keener,Do you have PTSD?
543,Tony Stark,I don't think so.
544,Harley Keener,"Are you...are you going completely mental? I can stop, do you want me to stop? Do you want me to stop?"
545,Tony Stark,"Remember when I said to stop doing that? I swear to God, you're going to freak me out!  Ah man, you did it, didn't you? You happy now?"
546,Harley Keener,What did I say?
547,Tony Stark,"Your fault, you spazzed me out. Okay, back to business. Where were we? The guy who died...relatives? Mom? Mrs. Davis, where is she?"
548,Harley Keener,Where she always is.
549,Tony Stark,"See, now you're being helpful."
550,Brandt,Thank you.
551,Tony Stark,"Nice haircut, suits you."
552,Brandt,Nice watch.
553,Tony Stark,"Yeah, limited edition."
554,Brandt,"Oh, I don't doubt it."
555,Tony Stark,"Mrs. Davis, mind if I join you?"
556,Mrs. Davis,Free country.
557,Tony Stark,It sure is.
558,Mrs. Davis,Alright. Where'd you like to start?
559,Tony Stark,I just want to say I'm sorry about your loss. I want to know what you think happened.
560,Mrs. Davis,"Look, I brought your damn file. You take it and go."
561,Tony Stark,"Clearly, you're waiting for someone else. Yeah? Supposed to meet somebody here?"
562,Mrs. Davis,Yeah.
563,Tony Stark,"Mrs. Davis, your son didn't kill himself, I guarantee you. He didn't kill anyone. Someone used him."
564,Mrs. Davis,What?
565,Tony Stark,As a weapon.
566,Mrs. Davis,"You're not the person who called me after all, are you?"
567,Brandt,"Actually, I am."
568,Rose Hills Sheriff,"Hey, hey, hey! What's all this about? What the hell's going on here?"
569,Brandt,"It's called an arrest.  Sheriff, is it?"
570,Rose Hills Sheriff,"Yes ma'am, it is. And you are?"
571,Brandt,Homeland Security.  We good here?
572,Rose Hills Sheriff,"No, we're not good. I need a little more information than that."
573,Brandt,"Well, I think it's a little above your pay grade, Sheriff."
574,Rose Hills Sheriff,"Yeah, well, why don't you get on the horn to Nashville and uh...upgrade me?"
575,Brandt,"Alright, you know what? I was hoping to do this the smart way, but uh...the fun way's always good."
576,Rose Hills Sheriff,"Deputy, get this woman and..."
577,Tony Stark,"Hey hot wings, you wanna party? You and me, let's go.  Crazy, huh?"
578,Rose Hill Christmas Tree Shopper,Yeah.
579,Tony Stark,Watch this.
580,Brandt,That's all you got? Cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?
581,Tony Stark,"Sweetheart, that could be the name of my autobiography."
582,Harley Keener,Let me go!
583,Savin,"Help me! Help me!  Hey kid, what would you like for Christmas?"
584,Harley Keener,"Mr. Stark, I am so sorry!"
585,Savin,"Oh. No, no. I think he was trying to say, ""I want my god damn file."""
586,Tony Stark,"It's not your fault, kid. Remember what I told you about bullies."
587,Harley Keener,You're welcome
588,Tony Stark,For what? Did I miss something?
589,Harley Keener,Me saving your life
590,Tony Stark,"Yeah. A, saved you first. B, thanks, sort of. And C, if you do someone a solid, don't be a yutz, alright? Just play it cool otherwise you come off grandiose."
591,Harley Keener,"Unlike you? Admit it, you need me. We're connected."
592,Tony Stark,"What I need is for you to go home, be with your mom, keep your trap shut, guard the suit and stay connected to the telephone because if I call, you better pick up. Okay, can you feel that? We're done here. Move it out the way or I'm going to run you over. Bye kid.  I'm sorry, kid, you did good."
593,Harley Keener,"So now you're just going to leave me here, like my dad?"
594,Tony Stark,"Yep  Wait, you're guilt tripping me, aren't you?"
595,Harley Keener,I'm cold.
596,Tony Stark,
597,Harley Keener,It was worth a shot.
598,Government Employee,"Mr Vice President, I think you should see this."
599,Vice President,"Oh god, not again. Is the President getting this?"
600,The Mandarin,"Mr President. Only two lessons remain and I intend to finish this before Christmas morning. Meet Thomas Richards.  But I'm sure he's a really good guy. I'm going to shoot him in the head, live on your television in 30 seconds."
601,Thomas Richards,No!
602,The Mandarin,"The number for this telephone is in your cell phone. Exciting, isn't it, imagining how it got there? America, if your president calls me in the next half-minute, Tom lives. Go!"
603,Government Official #1,How did he hack my phone?
604,Government Official #2,We can't allow terrorists to dictate...
605,President Ellis,I have to make this call.
606,Government Official #2,I'd strongly advise against that.
607,President Ellis,This is the right thing to do.
608,The Mandarin,"There's just one lesson left, President Ellis. So run away, hide, kiss your children goodbye. Because nothing, not your army, not your red, white and blue attack dog, can save you. I'll see you soon."
609,President Ellis,"Tell Rhodes, find this lunatic right now."
610,Military Aide,"Sir, we tracked the broadcast signal. We have a possible point of origin in Pakistan and the Patriot is ready to strike."
611,President Ellis,Right now.
612,Military Aide,"Yes, sir."
613,Tony Stark,"Man. Happy, Happy, Happy-"
614,Rhodey,Don't move!  Uh... Hang on a second. Hello?
615,Tony Stark,"You ever have a chick straddling you and you look up and suddenly she's glowing from the inside out, kind of a bright orange?"
616,Rhodey,"Yeah, I've had that. Who is this?"
617,Tony Stark,"It's me, pal. Now, last time I went missing, if I remember correctly, you came looking for me. What are you doing?"
618,Rhodey,"A little knock-and-talk, making friends in Pakistan. What are you doing?"
619,Tony Stark,"Your redesign, your big rebrand, that was AIM, right?"
620,Rhodey,Yeah.
621,Tony Stark,"I'm gonna find a heavy-duty comm sat right now, I need your login."
622,Rhodey,"It's the same as it's always been, ""WarMachine68."""
623,Tony Stark,"And password, please."
624,Rhodey,"Well, look, I gotta change it every time you hack in, Tony."
625,Tony Stark,"It's not the '80s, nobody says ""hack"" any more. Give me your login."
626,Rhodey,"""WAR MACHINE ROX"" with an ""X,"" all caps."
627,Tony Stark,"That is so much better than ""lron Patriot."""
628,EMCEE,Very nice. Very nice. I have one question for you. What would you like for Christmas this year?
629,Elk Ridge,"Well, David..."
630,Crew,Do not erase a programme from my DVR unless you are 100% sure...
631,EMCEE,"One more time! Ms Elk Ridge, everybody! All right."
632,Cameraman,Because you erase my shows!
633,Tony Stark,That ain't gonna cut it.
634,Cameraman,"We talked about this. Excuse me, sir. I don't know who..."
635,Tony Stark,Shh.
636,Cameraman,"Mom, I need to call you back. Something magical is happening. Tony Stark is in my van."
637,Tony Stark,Shh. Keep it down.
638,Cameraman,Tony Stark is in my van!
639,Tony Stark,"No, he's not."
640,Cameraman,I knew you were still alive!
641,Tony Stark,Come on in. Close the door.  Shh...
642,Cameraman,"Oh, wow. Can I just say, sir..."
643,Tony Stark,Yep.
644,Cameraman,I am your biggest fan.
645,Tony Stark,"Okay. First, is this your van? Is anyone else gonna come in?"
646,Cameraman,"No, no, no. Just us."
647,Tony Stark,Great. What's your name?
648,Cameraman,Gary
649,Tony Stark,Gary?
650,Gary,"Oh, wow."
651,Tony Stark,Right there is fine.
652,Gary,Okay.
653,Tony Stark,"Okay? I get a lot of this, it's okay."
654,Gary,"Oh, good. Can I just say?"
655,Tony Stark,What do you want?
656,Gary,"Yeah. I don't know if you can tell, but I have, like, patterned my whole look after you. My hair's a little..."
657,Tony Stark,It's fine.
658,Gary,"It's not right, 'cause there's no product in it."
659,Tony Stark,Right.
660,Gary,"I don't want to make things awkward for you, but I do have to show you... Boom!"
661,Tony Stark,A Hispanic Scott Baio. I'm sorry. Is that me?
662,Gary,"Yeah. It's... I mean... I had them do it off a doll that I made, so it's not like it's off a picture. So it's a little bit..."
663,Tony Stark,"Gary. Listen to me, okay? I don't want to clip your wings, here. We're both a little over-excited. I got an issue. I'm chasing bad guys. I'm trying to grab a little something from some hard-crypt data files. I don't have enough juice. I need you to jump on the roof... Right? Recalibrate the lSDNs. Pump it up by about 40%."
664,Gary,Got it.
665,Tony Stark,All right? It's a mission.
666,Gary,Yeah.
667,Tony Stark,Tony needs Gary.
668,Gary,And Gary needs Tony.
669,Tony Stark,Be quiet about it. Go.
670,Gary,Yeah.
671,Aldrich Killian,What would you regard as the defining moment of your life?
672,Chad Davis,"Well, uh, I think that would be the day I decided not to let my injury beat me."
673,Aldrich Killian,Will you please state your name for the camera?
674,Brandt,Ellen Brandt.
675,Aldrich Killian,"Okay. So, the injections are administered periodically. Addiction will not be tolerated. And those who cannot regulate will be out from the programme."
676,Tony Stark,"A bomb is not a bomb when it's a misfire. The stuff doesn't always work. Right, pal? It's faulty, but you found a buyer, didn't you? Sold it to the Mandarin. Got you, pal."
677,Maya Hansen,"What happened? Fun fact. Before he built rockets for the Nazis, the idealistic Wernher von Braun dreamed of space travel. He stargazed. Do you know what he said when the first V-2 hit London? ""The rocket performed perfectly. It just landed on the wrong planet."" See, we all begin wide-eyed. Pure science. And then the ego steps in, the obsession. And you look up, you're a long way from shore."
678,Pepper Potts,"You can't be too hard on yourself, Maya. I mean, you gave your research to a think tank."
679,Maya Hansen,"Yeah, but Killian built that think tank on military contracts."
680,Pepper Potts,"That's exactly what we used to do. So, don't judge yourself."
681,Maya Hansen,"Thank you, Pepper. I really appreciate that."
682,Pepper Potts,"Maya, run! [Killian grabs Pepper by the arm, spins her around and slams her against the wall, holding her by the neck."
683,Aldrich Killian,"Hi, Pepper.  So, you want to tell me why you were at Stark's mansion last night?"
684,Maya Hansen,I'm trying to fix this thing. I didn't know you and the master were gonna blow the place up.
685,Aldrich Killian,"Oh, I see. So, you were trying to save Stark when he threatened us?"
686,Maya Hansen,"I've told you, Killian, we can use him."
687,Aldrich Killian,Pepper. Pepper. Pepper.
688,Maya Hansen,"Look, if we want to launch product next year, I need Stark. He just lacked a decent incentive. Now, he has one."
689,Man,This is support team Blue-Zero. Sending coordinates for a suspected Mandarin broadcast point of origin.
690,Rhodey,Copy.
691,Woman,Savin? I've acquired the Patriot armour.
692,Rhodey,"If you want this suit, you're going to have to pry my cold dead body out of it."
693,Woman,"That's the plan, Colonel."
694,Tony Stark,"Harley, tell me what's happening. Give me a full report."
695,Harley Keener,"Yeah, I'm still eating that candy. Do you want me to keep eating it?"
696,Tony Stark,How much have you had?
697,Harley Keener,Two or three bowls.
698,Tony Stark,Can you still see straight?
699,Harley Keener,Sort of.
700,Tony Stark,"That means you're fine. Give me Jarvis. Jarvis, how are we?"
701,JARVIS,"It's totally fine, sir. I seem to do quite well for a stretch, and then at the end of the sentence I say the wrong cranberry. And, sir, you were right. Once I factored in available AIM downlink facilities I was able to pinpoint the Mandarin's broadcast signal."
702,Tony Stark,"What are we talking? Far East, Europe, North Africa, Iran, Pakistan, Syria? Where is it?"
703,JARVIS,"Actually, sir, it's in Miami."
704,Tony Stark,"Okay, kid, I'm gonna have to walk you through rebooting Jarvis's speech drive, but not right now. Harley, where is he really? Just look on the screen and tell me where it is."
705,Harley Keener,"Um, it does say Miami, Florida."
706,Tony Stark,"Okay, first things first, I need the armour. Where are we at with it?"
707,Harley Keener,"Uh, it's not charging."
708,JARVIS,"Actually, sir, it is charging, but the power source is questionable. It may not succeed in revitalising the Mark 42."
709,Tony Stark,"What's questionable about electricity? All right? It's my suit, and I can't... I'm not gonna... I don't wanna...  Oh, God, not again."
710,Harley Keener,Tony?  Are you having another attack? I didn't even mention New York.
711,Tony Stark,"Right, and then you just said it by name while denying having said it."
712,Harley Keener,"Okay, um, uh..."
713,Tony Stark,"God, what am I gonna do?"
714,Harley Keener,"Just breathe. Really, just breathe. You're a mechanic, right?"
715,Tony Stark,Right.
716,Harley Keener,You said so.
717,Tony Stark,"Yes, I did."
718,Harley Keener,Why don't you just build something?
719,Tony Stark,"Okay. Thanks, kid."
720,Woman,Why is it so hot in here? I told you to put it at 68.
721,Man,
722,The Mandarin,"Well, I wouldn't go in there for 20 minutes.  Now, which one of you is Vanessa?"
723,Vanessa,That's me.
724,The Mandarin,Ah! Nessie. Did you know that fortune cookies aren't even Chinese?
725,Vanessa,There's some guy over here.
726,The Mandarin,"They're made by Americans, based on a Japanese recipe."
727,Tony Stark,Hey!
728,The Mandarin,Bloody hell. Bloody hell.
729,Tony Stark,Don't move.
730,The Mandarin,I'm not moving. You want something? Take it. Although the guns are all fake because those wankers wouldn't trust me with the real ones.
731,Tony Stark,What?
732,The Mandarin,"Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?"
733,Tony Stark,"Heard enough. You're not him. The Mandarin, the real guy. Where? Where's the Mandarin? Where is he?"
734,The Mandarin,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's here. He's here, but he's not here. He's here, but he's not here."
735,Tony Stark,What do you mean?
736,The Mandarin,"It's complicated. Hey, it's complicated."
737,Tony Stark,It is?
738,The Mandarin,It's complicated.
739,Tony Stark,"Uncomplicate it. Ladies, out. Get out of the bed. Get into the bathroom. Sit."
740,The Mandarin,My name is Trevor. Trevor Slattery.
741,Tony Stark,"What are you? What are you, a decoy? You're a double, right?"
742,Trevor Slattery,"What, you mean like an understudy? No, absolutely not.  Don't hurt the face! I'm an actor."
743,Tony Stark,You got a minute to live. Fill it with words.
744,Trevor Slattery,"It's just a role. ""The Mandarin,"" see, it's not real."
745,Tony Stark,"Then how did you get here, Trevor?"
746,Trevor Slattery,"Um. Well, I, um, had a little problem with, um, substances. And I ended up, um, doing things, no two ways about it, in the street, that a man shouldn't do."
747,Tony Stark,Next?
748,Trevor Slattery,"Then, they approached me about the role, and they knew about the drugs."
749,Tony Stark,What did they say? They'd get you off them?
750,Trevor Slattery,They said they'd give me more. They gave me things. They gave me this palace. They gave me plastic surgery. They gave me things.
751,Tony Stark,Did you just nod off? Hey.
752,Trevor Slattery,"No, and a lovely speedboat. And the thing was, he needed someone to take credit for some accidental explosions."
753,Tony Stark,"""He""? Killian?"
754,Trevor Slattery,Killian.
755,Tony Stark,He created you?
756,Trevor Slattery,He created me.
757,Tony Stark,Custom-made terror threat.
758,Trevor Slattery,"Yes. Yes. His think tank thinked it up. The pathology of a serial killer. The manipulation of Western iconography. Ready for another lesson? Blah, blah, blah. No. Of course, it was my performance that brought the Mandarin to life."
759,Tony Stark,Your performance? Where people died?
760,Trevor Slattery,"No, they didn't. Look around you. The costumes, green screen. Honestly, I wasn't on location for half this stuff. And when I was, it was movie magic, love."
761,Tony Stark,"I'm sorry, but I got a best friend who's in a coma and he might not wake up. So you're gonna have to answer for that. You're still going down, pal. You under..."
762,Savin,"Okay, Trevor, what did you tell him?"
763,Trevor Slattery,I didn't tell him anything.
764,Savin,Nothing?
765,Trevor Slattery,No.
766,Savin,You should have pressed the panic button.
767,Trevor Slattery,"Well, I panicked, but then I handled it."
768,Tony Stark,Ah...  Okay.
769,Maya Hansen,"It's just like old times, huh?"
770,Tony Stark,"Oh, yeah. With zip ties. It's a ball."
771,Maya Hansen,It wasn't my idea.
772,Tony Stark,Okay. So you took Killian's card.
773,Maya Hansen,I took his money.
774,Tony Stark,"And here you are 13 years later, in a dungeon."
775,Maya Hansen,No.
776,Tony Stark,Yeah.
777,Maya Hansen,"No, you're in a dungeon. I'm free to go."
778,Tony Stark,Yeah?
779,Maya Hansen,"A lot has happened, Tony. But I'm close. Extremis is practically stabilised."
780,Tony Stark,"I'm on the street. People are going bang. They're painting the walls. Maya, you're kidding yourself."
781,Maya Hansen,Then help me fix it.
782,Tony Stark,Did I do that?
783,Maya Hansen,Yes.
784,Tony Stark,"I remember the night, not the morning. Is this what you've been chasing around?"
785,Maya Hansen,You don't remember?
786,Tony Stark,I can't help you. You used to have a moral psychology. You used to have ideals. You wanted to help people. Now look at you. I get to wake up every morning with someone who still has their soul. Get me out of here. Come on.
787,Aldrich Killian,"You know what my old man used to say to me? One of his favourite of many sayings... ""The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese."""
788,Tony Stark,"You're not still pissed off about the Switzerland thing, are you?"
789,Aldrich Killian,"How can I be pissed at you, Tony? I'm here to thank you. You gave me the greatest gift that anybody's ever given me. Desperation. If you think back to Switzerland, you said you'd meet me on the rooftop, right? Well, for the first 20 minutes, I actually thought you'd show up. And the next hour... I considered taking that one-step shortcut to the lobby. If you know what I mean."
790,Tony Stark,"Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out what happened to the first mouse."
791,Aldrich Killian,"But as I looked out over that city, nobody knew I was there, nobody could see me, no one was even looking. I had a thought that would guide me for years to come. Anonymity, Tony. Thanks to you, it's been my mantra ever since. Right? You simply rule from behind the scenes. Because the second you give evil a face, a bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin, you hand the people a target."
792,Tony Stark,You're something else.
793,Aldrich Killian,"You have met him, I assume?"
794,Tony Stark,Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.
795,Aldrich Killian,"I know he's a little over the top sometimes. It's not entirely my fault. He has a tenden... He's a stage actor. They say his Lear was the toast of Croydon, wherever that is. Anyway, the point is, ever since that big dude with the hammer fell out of the sky, subtlety has kind of had its day."
796,Tony Stark,What's next for you in your world?
797,Aldrich Killian,"Well, I wanted to repay you the selfsame gift that you so graciously imparted to me.  Desperation. Now, this is live. I'm not sure if you can tell, but at this moment the body is trying to decide whether to accept Extremis or just give up. And if it gives up, I have to say, the detonation is quite spectacular. But until that point, it's really just a lot of pain. We haven't even talked salary yet. What kind of perk package are you thinking of?"
798,Maya Hansen,Let him go.
799,Aldrich Killian,"Hold on, hold on. Maya..."
800,Maya Hansen,"I said, let him go."
801,Aldrich Killian,What are you doing?
802,Maya Hansen,"1200 CCs. A dose half of this size, I'm dead."
803,Aldrich Killian,"It's times like this my temper is tested somewhat. Maya, give me the injector."
804,Maya Hansen,"If I die, Killian, what happens to your soldiers? What happens to your product?"
805,Aldrich Killian,"We're not doing this, okay?"
806,Maya Hansen,What happens to you? What happens if you go too hot?
807,Aldrich Killian,"The good news is, a high-level position has just been vacated."
808,Tony Stark,You are a maniac.
809,Aldrich Killian,"No, I'm a visionary. But I do own a maniac. And he takes the stage tonight.  Once we get the Patriot installed, it will take me nine or 10 minutes for the takedown."
810,Savin,"Well, that's great, but the last time I looked there was somebody inside of it."
811,Aldrich Killian,"Afternoon, gentlemen.  Oh! We'll get you out of there. Don't worry."
812,Savin,You'll damage the armour.
813,Aldrich Killian,"Yes, I will. But you can fix it, right? I'm gonna take the Chinook to base camp. And I want Potts with me."
814,Savin,She's still in Phase Two.
815,Aldrich Killian,"You're not going deaf, are you?"
816,Tony Stark,"Careful, there. It's a limited edition. Hey, uh, Ponytail Express. What's the mileage count between Tennessee and Miami?"
817,Guard #1,832 miles.
818,Tony Stark,Very nice.
819,Guard #1,"I'm good like that. Can you, uh, stop that?"
820,Tony Stark,"Break it, you bought it."
821,Guard #2,I think I bought it.
822,Tony Stark,"Okay, that wasn't mine to give away. That belongs to my friend's sister. And that's why I'm gonna kill you first."
823,Guard #2,What are you gonna do to me?
824,Tony Stark,You'll see.
825,Guard #2,You're zip-tied to a bed. This.
826,Alrich Killian,Are you coming out?
827,Rhodey,
828,Aldrich Killian,"It's a glorious day, Savin. This time tomorrow, I'll have the West's most powerful leader in one hand, and the world's most feared terrorist in the other. I'll own the war on terror. Create supply and demand. For you, for your brothers and sisters."
829,Tony Stark,"Trust me, you're gonna be in a puddle of blood on the ground in five, four, three... Come on! Two..."
830,Guard #2,How did we get this shift?
831,Tony Stark,"All right, I'm gonna give you a chance to escape. Put down your weapons. Tie yourselves to those chairs. I'll let you live. In five, four, bang!"
832,Guard #2,Wow. That was...
833,Tony Stark,You should be gone by now. You should've already been gone.
834,Guard #2,I am just beyond terrified.
835,Tony Stark,"Here it comes. Three, four..."
836,Guard #2,Shut up.
837,Tony Stark,
838,Man,"Honestly, I hate working here. They are so weird."
839,Tony Stark,"Ah! Better late than never.  Not this time. Not the face. Phew! It's good to be back. Hello, by the way."
840,JARVIS,"Oh, hello, sir."
841,Guard,"All personnel, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound. Repeat, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound."
842,Tony Stark,"Ah! Let's go!  Aw, crap."
843,Rhodey,Tony?
844,Tony Stark,"Rhodey, tell me that was you in the suit."
845,Rhodey,No. You got yours'?
846,Tony Stark,"Uh... Mmm. Kind of. Main house, as fast as you can. There's somebody I'd like you to meet."
847,Rhodey,"You, you, you! Move! Get out!"
848,Tony Stark,The room is secure. I have eyes on the Mandarin.
849,Rhodey,What's this? I had winners.
850,Tony Stark,What have you come as?
851,Rhodey,"You make a move, and I break your face."
852,Tony Stark,I never thought people had been hurt. They lied to me.
853,Rhodey,This is the Mandarin?
854,Tony Stark,"Yeah, I know, it's... It's embarrassing."
855,Trevor Slattery,"Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery. I know I'm shorter in person. A bit smaller. Everyone says that. But, um, hey, if you're here to arrest me, there's some people I'd like to roll on."
856,Tony Stark,"Here's how it works, Meryl Streep."
857,Rhodey,You tell him where Pepper is and he'll stop doing it.
858,Trevor Slattery,"Doing what? Ow, I get it! Ow! That hurt. I get it! I get it! I don't know about any Pepper, but I know about the plan."
859,Tony Stark,Spill.
860,Rhodey,Do you know what they did to my suit?
861,Tony Stark,What? No. But I do know it's happening off the coast. Something to do with a big boat. I can take you there.
862,Trevor Slattery,"Woah!  Ole', ole', ole', ole'..."
863,Rhodey,"Tony, I swear to God, I'm gonna blow his face off."
864,Tony Stark,"Oh, and this next bit may include the vice president as well. Is that... Is that important?"
865,Rhodey,"Yeah, a little bit."
866,Tony Stark,So?
867,Rhodey,"What are we gonna do? I mean, we don't have any transport."
868,Tony Stark,"Right.  Hey, Ringo. Didn't you say something about a ""lovely speedboat""? If he's right about the location, we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is."
869,Rhodey,"But we also have to figure out this vice president thing, right?"
870,Tony Stark,Right. I wonder who I'm calling right now. Oh! That's the vice president.
871,Vice President,Thanks. Hello?
872,Tony Stark,"Sir, this is Tony Stark."
873,Vice President,Welcome back to the land of the living.
874,Tony Stark,We believe you're about to be drawn into the Mandarin campaign. We gotta get you somewhere safe as soon as possible.
875,Vice President,"Mr Stark, I'm about to eat honey-roast ham, surrounded by the Agency's finest. The president's safe on Air Force One with Colonel Rhodes. I think we're good, here."
876,Rhodey,"Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes. They're using the Iron Patriot as a Trojan horse. They're gonna take out the president somehow. We have to immediately alert that plane."
877,Vice President,"Okay, I'm on it. I'll have security lock it down. If need be, they can have F-22s in the air in 30 seconds. Thank you, Colonel."
878,Rhodey,Rhodes and Stark out.
879,Man,"Everything okay, sir?"
880,Vice President,"Couldn't be better.  I love you, babe."
881,President Ellis,"Colonel Rhodes.  Glad to see you could make it, son. I feel safer already."
882,Rhodey,"We gotta make a decision. We can either save the president, or Pepper. We can't do both."
883,JARVIS,"Sir, I have an update from Malibu. The cranes have finally arrived, and the cellar doors are being cleared as we speak."
884,Tony Stark,And what about the suit I'm wearing?
885,JARVIS,The armour is now at 92%.
886,Tony Stark,That's going to have to do.
887,Military Aide,"Everything all right, Colonel? [Iron Patriot kills the aide and people begin shooting at him. He kills everyone beside the President. The helmet lifts up to reveal Savin."
888,Savin,"It is an honour, Mr President."
889,President Ellis,"If you're gonna do it, do it!"
890,Savin,"Whoa! Cool your boots, sir. That's not how the Mandarin works."
891,Officer,"Sir, Air Force One has been compromised. Internal shots, temperature spikes."
892,Officer #2,Get me eyes on it now.
893,Officer,"Image coming through now, sir."
894,Officer #2,Was that Rhodes?
895,Man,Is anyone there?
896,Woman,Let us out!
897,Tony Stark,The President. Now.
898,Savin,He's not here.
899,Tony Stark,"Walk away from that, you son of a bitch.  How many in the air?"
900,JARVIS,"Thirteen, sir."
901,Tony Stark,How many can I carry?
902,JARVIS,"Four, sir."
903,Tony Stark,"Slow down. Slow down, relax. What's your name? Heather?"
904,Heather,"Oh, God! No! No!"
905,Tony Stark,"Listen to me. See that guy? I'm gonna swing by, you're just gonna grab him. You got it?"
906,Heather,What? Oh!
907,Tony Stark,"I'll electrify your arm, you won't be able to open your hand. We can do this, Heather. Easy, see? Eleven more to go. Remember that game called Barrel of Monkeys? That's what we're going to do."
908,JARVIS,"18,000 feet."
909,Tony Stark,"Come on, people. Everybody, grab your monkey. Nice."
910,JARVIS,"10,000 feet. 6,000 feet."
911,Tony Stark,"Come on, people. Come on, come on, come on! Yeah!"
912,JARVIS,"1, 000 feet. 400 feet. 200 feet, sir."
913,Tony Stark,"He's a chunky monkey, let's get him. Hello."
914,Man,We made it!
915,Tony Stark,"Nice work, guys! Excellent. Good team effort all around. Go us. All right, Jarvis. But it's only half-done. We've still got to get Pepper..."
916,Rhodey,"Give me some good news, man."
917,Tony Stark,I think they all made it.
918,Rhodey,"Oh, thank God."
919,Tony Stark,"Yeah, but I missed the president."
920,Rhodey,"You couldn't save the president with the suit, how are we gonna save Pepper with nothing?"
921,Tony Stark,"Uh... Say, Jarvis, is it that time?"
922,JARVIS,"The House Party Protocol, sir?"
923,Tony Stark,Correct.
924,Aldrich Killian,Hi.
925,Pepper Potts,You think he's gonna help you? He won't.
926,Aldrich Killian,"Having you here is not just to motivate Tony Stark. It's, um... Well, it's actually more embarrassing than that. You're here as my, um..."
927,Pepper Potts,Trophy
928,Aldrich Killian,"Welcome aboard, Mr President. Ever hear of an elephant graveyard? Well, two years ago, the elephant in the room was this scow."
929,President Ellis,This is the Roxxon Norco.
930,Aldrich Killian,"And, of course, you'll remember that when she spilled a million gallons of crude off Pensacola, thanks to you, not one fat cat saw a day in court."
931,President Ellis,What do you want from me?
932,Aldrich Killian,"Uh, nothing, sir. I just needed a reason to kill you that would play well on TV. You see, I've moved on. I found myself a new political patron, and this time tomorrow, he'll have your job. String him up."
933,President Ellis,Hey!
934,Rhodey,"Come on. You're not gonna freak out on me, right?"
935,Tony Stark,I hope not.
936,Rhodey,"Oh, my God.  He's strung up over the oil tanker. They're gonna light him up, man."
937,Tony Stark,Viking funeral. Public execution.
938,Rhodey,"Yeah, death by oil."
939,Announcer,Broadcast will commence shortly. Take final positions.
940,Aldrich Killian,Okay. That's good. Now give me cameras A through E and we'll do a full tech rehearsal.
941,Rhodey,ls your gun up?
942,Tony Stark,Yep. What do I do?
943,Rhodey,"Stay on my six, cover high and don't shoot me in the back."
944,Tony Stark,"Six, high, back. Alright.  You see that? Nailed it."
945,Rhodey,"Yeah, you really killed the glass."
946,Tony Stark,You think I was aiming for the bulb? You can't hit a bulb at this distance.
947,Announcer,"All personnel, we have hostiles on east unit 12."
948,Man,Over there!
949,Announcer,"I repeat, hostiles on east unit 12."
950,Tony Stark,I'm out. Give me. You got extra magazines?
951,Rhodey,"They're not universal, Tony."
952,Tony Stark,"I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff. Give me another one."
953,Rhodey,Okay
954,Tony Stark,Give me one of yours.
955,Rhodey,I don't have one that fits that gun.
956,Tony Stark,"You've got, like, five of them. Here's what I'm going to do. Save my spot, ready?"
957,Rhodey,What'd you see?
958,Tony Stark,"Too fast. Nothing. Here we go.  Three guys, one girl, all armed."
959,Rhodey,"God, I would kill for some armour right now."
960,Tony Stark,You're right. We need backup.
961,Rhodey,"Yeah, a bunch."
962,Tony Stark,You know what?
963,Rhodey,Is that...?
964,Tony Stark,Yep.
965,Rhodey,Are those...?
966,Tony Stark,"Yeah.  Merry Christmas, buddy. JARVIS, target Extremis heat signatures. Disable with extreme prejudice."
967,JARVIS,"Yes, sir."
968,Tony Stark,What are you waiting for? It's Christmas. Take them to church.
969,JARVIS,Gentlemen.
970,Tony Stark,"Incoming! Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing."
971,Rhodey,"This is how you've been managing your down time, huh?"
972,Tony Stark,"Everybody needs a hobby. Heartbreaker, help Red Snapper out, will you?  Nice timing."
973,Rhodey,"Oh, yeah. That's awesome. Give me a suit, okay?"
974,Tony Stark,"Oh, I'm sorry, they're only coded to me."
975,Rhodey,What does that mean?
976,Tony Stark,I got you covered.
977,JARVIS,"Good evening, Colonel. Can I give you a lift?"
978,Rhodey,Very funny.
979,JARVIS,"Sir, I've located Ms Potts."
980,Tony Stark,About time.
981,Pepper Potts,Stop! Put it down. Put it down. Put it down.
982,Tony Stark,See what happens when you hang out with my ex-girlfriends?
983,Pepper Potts,You're such a jerk.
984,Tony Stark,Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner.
985,Aldrich Killian,"Is this guy bothering you? Don't get up. Ooh. Is it hot in there?  Stuck? Do you feel a little stuck? Like a little turtle, cooking in his little turtle suit."
986,Pepper Potts,Tony.
987,Aldrich Killian,She's watching. I think you should close your eyes. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. You don't want to see this.
988,Tony Stark,"Yeah, you take a minute.  Oh, come on!"
989,Rhodey,"Mr President! Just hold on, all right? I'm coming. Just hold on. Hold on.  Oh, kay. Bye-bye. Brace yourself.  You look damn good, Mr President, but I'm gonna need that suit back. The President is secure, Tony. I'm clearing the area."
990,Tony Stark,Nice work.
991,Rhodey,"Ready, sir?"
992,President Ellis,"What do you mean ""ready""?"
993,Tony Stark,"Pep, I got you. Relax, I got you. Just look at me! Honey, I can't reach any further and you can't stay there. All right? You've got to let go. You've got to let go! I'll catch you, I promise. No!"
994,Aldrich Killian,A shame. I would've caught her.
995,Tony Stark,Eject.
996,Aldrich Killian,"Well, here we are on the roof."
997,JARVIS,"Mark 42, inbound."
998,Tony Stark,I'll be damned. The prodigal son returns.  Whatever.
999,Aldrich Killian,"You really didn't deserve her, Tony. It's a pity. I was so close to having her perfect."
1000,Tony Stark,"Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait! Slow down! Slow down! You're right. I don't deserve her. Here's where you're wrong. She was already perfect.  Jarvis, do me a favour and blow Mark 42."
1001,Aldrich Killian,
1002,Tony Stark,I got nothing.  Honey?
1003,Pepper Potts,"Oh, my God. That was really violent."
1004,Tony Stark,You just scared the devil out of me. I thought you were...
1005,Pepper Potts,I was dead. Why? Because I fell 200 feet? Who's the hot mess now?
1006,Tony Stark,It's still debatable. Probably tipping your way a little bit. Why don't you dress like this at home? Hmm? Sport bra. The whole deal.
1007,Pepper Potts,"You know, I think I understand why you don't want to give up the suits. What am I going to complain about now?"
1008,Tony Stark,"Well, it's me. You'll think of something. Come here."
1009,Pepper Potts,"No, don't touch me."
1010,Tony Stark,Don't worry about it.
1011,Pepper Potts,"No, I'm gonna burn you."
1012,Tony Stark,"No, you're not. Not hot."
1013,Pepper Potts,Am I gonna be okay?
1014,Tony Stark,"No. You're in a relationship with me. Everything will never be okay. But I think I can figure this out, yeah. I almost had this 20 years ago when I was drunk. I think I can get you better. That's what I do. I fix stuff."
1015,Pepper Potts,And all your distractions?
1016,Tony Stark,Uh... I'm going to shave them down a little bit. Jarvis. Hey.
1017,JARVIS,"All wrapped up here, sir. Will there be anything else?"
1018,Tony Stark,You know what to do.
1019,JARVIS,"The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?"
1020,Tony Stark,"Screw it, it's Christmas. Yes, yes.  Okay, so far? Do you like it?"
1021,Pepper Potts,It'll do.
1022,Tony Stark,"And so, as Christmas morning began, my journey had reached its end. You start with something pure, something exciting. Then, come the mistakes. The compromises. We create our own demons."
1023,Trevor Slattery,"Oh! Great to see you! Oh, bloody hell!"
1024,Tony Stark,"But then I thought to myself, ""Why stop there?"" Of course, there are people who say progress is dangerous, but I'll bet none of those idiots ever had to live with a chestful of shrapnel. And now, neither will I. Let me tell you, that was the best sleep I'd had in years."
1025,Nurse,It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
1026,Happy Hogan,"No, look."
1027,Tony Stark,"You know, and thank you by the way. For listening. Plus, something about just getting it off my chest, and putting it out there in the atmosphere, instead of holding this in... I mean, this is what gets people sick, you know. Wow, I had no idea you were such a good listener."
1028,Tony Stark,"To be able to share all my intimate thoughts and my experiences with someone, it just cuts the weight of it in half. You know, it's like a snake swallowing its own tail. Everything comes full circle.  Are you with me?"
1029,Bruce Banner,"Sorry... I was, yeah. We were at, uh..."
1030,Tony Stark,Are you actively napping?
1031,Bruce Banner,I was... I... I drifted.
1032,Tony Stark,Where did I lose you?
1033,Bruce Banner,Elevator in Switzerland.
1034,Tony Stark,"So, you heard none of it?"
1035,Bruce Banner,I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor. I'm not a therapist. It's not my training.
1036,Tony Stark,So?
1037,Bruce Banner,I don't have the...
1038,Tony Stark,What? The time?
1039,Bruce Banner,Temperament.
1040,Tony Stark,"You know what? Now that I think about it... Oh! God, my original wound. 1983, all right?"
1041,Bruce Banner,Yes.
1042,Tony Stark,"I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny. That was weird."
