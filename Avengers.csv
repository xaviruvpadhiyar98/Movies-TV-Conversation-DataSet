0,CUT TO,"EXT. THRONE ROOM, SPACE ­ NIGHT"
1,THE OTHER,"The tesseract has awakened. It is on a little world. A human world. They would wield its power,..."
2,Loki,
3,THE OTHER,"But our ally knows its workings as they never will. He is ready to lead. And our force, our Chitauri, will follow."
4,THE OTHER,"The world will be his. The universe yours. And the humans, what can they do but burn?"
5,NICK FURY,How bad is it?
6,AGENT PHIL COULSON,That's the problem sir. We don't know.
7,COULSON,Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from the Tesseract four hours ago.
8,FURY,NASA didn't authorise Selvig to test phase.
9,COULSON,"He wasn't testing it, he wasn't even in the room. Spontaneous advancement."
10,AGENT MARIA HILL,It just turned itself on?
11,FURY,What are the energy levels
12,COULSON,"Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down, we ordered evac."
13,FURY,How long to get everyone out?
14,COULSON,Campus should be clear in the next half hour.
15,FURY,Do better.
16,HILL,"Sir, evacuation may be futile."
17,FURY,We should tell them to go back to sleep?
18,HILL,"If we can't control the Tesseract's energy, there may not be a minimum safe distance."
19,FURY,I need you to make sure Phase 2 prototypes are shipped out.
20,HILL,"Sir, is that really a priority right now?"
21,FURY,"Until such a time as the world ends, we will act as though it intends to spin on. Clear out the tech below. Every peice of Phase 2 on a truck and gone."
22,HILL,Yes sir.  With me.
23,FURY,Talk to me doctor.
24,Dr. ERIK SELVIG,Director.
25,FURY,Is there anything we know for certain?
26,SELVIG,The Tesseract is misbehaving.
27,FURY,Is that supposed to be funny?
28,SELVIG,"No, it's not funny at all. The Tesseract is not only active, she's... misbehaving."
29,FURY,How soon until you pull the plug?
30,SELVIG,"She's an energy source. If we turn off the power, she turns it back on. If she reaches peak level..."
31,FURY,We've prepared for this doctor. Harnessing energy from space.
32,SELVIG,"We don't have the harness. Our calculations are far from complete. Now she's throwing off interference, radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation."
33,FURY,That can be harmful. Where's Barton?
34,SELVIG,"The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual"
35,FURY,"Agent Barton, report."
36,FURY,I gave you this detail so you could keep a close eye on things.
37,CLINT BARTON,"Well, I see better from a distance."
38,FURY,Are you seeing anything that might set this thing off?
39,NASA SCIENCETIST,"Doctor, it's spiking again."
40,CLINT,"No one's come or gone. It's oven is clean. No contancts, no I.M.'s. If there was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at this end."
41,FURY,At this end?
42,CLINT,"Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right? The doors open from both sides."
43,FURY,Sir please put down the spear.
44,LOKI,You have heart.
45,LOKI,Please don't. I still need that.
46,FURY,This doesn't have to get any messier.
47,LOKI,"Of course it does. I've come too far for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard, and I am burdened with glorious purpose."
48,SELVIG,Loki? Brother of Thor?
49,FURY,We have no quarrel with your people.
50,LOKI,An ant had no quarrel with a boot.
51,FURY,You planning to step on us?
52,LOKI,"I come with glad tidings, of a world made free."
53,FURY,Free from what?
54,LOKI,"Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie. Once you accept that, in your heart..."
55,LOKI,You will know peace.
56,FURY,"Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think you mean the other thing."
57,CLINT,"Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This place is about to blow. Drop a hundred feet of rock on us. He means to bury us."
58,FURY,Like the Pharaohs of Odin.
59,SELVIG,He's right. The portal is collapsing in on itself. You got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.
60,LOKI,Well then.
61,CLINT,Need these vehicles.
62,HILL,Who's that?
63,CLINT,He didn't tell me.
64,FURY,"Hill, do you copy?"
65,FURY,Barton is...
66,FURY,He's got the Tesseract! Track it down!
67,COULSON,No! Leave it!
68,COULSON,"You're clear, sir! You need to go!"
69,COULSON,"Director? Director Fury, do you copy?"
70,FURY,The tesseract is with the hostile force. I have men down. Hill?
71,HILL,"A lot of men still under, don't know how many survivors."
72,FURY,Sound the general call. I want every living soul not working rescue looking for that briefcase.
73,HILL,Roger that.
74,FURY,"Coulson, get back to base. This is a Level Seven. As of right now, we are at war."
75,COULSON,What do we do?
76,GENERAL LUCHKOV,This is not how I wanted the evening to go.
77,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I know how you wanted this evening to go. Believe me, this is better."
78,LUCHKOV,"I'd like to know why they sent you to carry out a carrier, a stained glass and other random items."
79,NATASHA,I thought General Solohob was in charge of the export business.
80,LUCHKOV,Solohob? Your reputation is quite a progression. The famous Black Widow. Nothing but a pretty face.
81,NATASHA,You really think I'm pretty?
82,LUCHKOV,"We do not need the Lermontov to transfer the tanks. Tell him, well...  You may have to write it down."
83,WEASELY THUG,Ya?  It's for you.
84,LUCHKOV,Who the hell is...
85,COULSON,"You're at 114 Solenski Plaza, 3rd floor. We have an F22 exactly 8 miles out. Put the woman on the phone or I will blow up the block before you can make the lobby."
86,COULSON,We need you to come in.
87,NATASHA,Are you kidding? I'm working!
88,COULSON,This takes precedence.
89,NATASHA,I'm in the middle of an interrogation and this moron is giving me everything.
90,LUCHKOV,I don't give everything.
91,NATASHA,"Look, you can't pull me out of this right now."
92,COULSON,Natasha. Barton's been compromised.
93,NATASHA,Let me put you on hold.
94,NATASHA,Where's Barton now?
95,COULSON,We don't know.
96,NATASHA,But he's alive.
97,COULSON,"We think so. I'll brief you on everything when you get back. But first, we need you to talk to the big guy."
98,NATASHA,"Coulson, you know that Stark only trusts me about as far as he can throw me."
99,COULSON,"No, I've got Stark. You get the big guy."
100,NATASHA,
101,ATTENDING WOMAN,What are you doing here?! Get out! You shouldn't be here.
102,LITTLE GIRL,I have to see the doctor. It's my father.
103,BRUCE,Calm down. What's wrong?
104,LITTLE GIRL,My father...
105,BRUCE,Is he like them?
106,LITTLE GIRL,Please.
107,BRUCE,"Should have gotten paid up front, Banner."
108,NATASHA,"You know, for a man who's supposed to be avoiding stress, you picked a hell of a place to settle."
109,BRUCE,Avoiding stress isn't the secret.
110,NATASHA,"Then, what is it? Yoga?"
111,BANNER,"You brought me to the edge of the city, smart. I uh... assume the whole place is surrounded?"
112,NATASHA,Just you and me.
113,BRUCE,"And your actress buddy, is she a spy too? Do they start that young?"
114,NATASHA,I did.
115,BRUCE,Who are you?
116,NATASHA,Natasha Romanoff.
117,BRUCE,"Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff? Because that's not gonna work out for everyone."
118,NATASHA,No. No. Of course not. I'm here on behalf of SHIELD.
119,BRUCE,SHIELD. How did they find me?
120,NATASHA,"We never lost you, doctor. We've kept our distance, even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent."
121,BRUCE,Why?
122,NATASHA,Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now I need you to come in.
123,BRUCE,What if I said no?
124,NATASHA,I'll persuade you.
125,BRUCE,And what if the... other guy says no?
126,NATASHA,You've been more than a year without an incident. I don't think you wanna break that streak.
127,BRUCE,I don't always get what I want.
128,NATASHA,"Doctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe."
129,BRUCE,"Well, those I actively try to avoid."
130,NATASHA,This is the Tesseract. It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.
131,BRUCE,What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it?
132,NATASHA,"Well, he wants you to find it. It's been taken. It emits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace. There's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do. If there was, that's where I'd be."
133,BRUCE,So Fury isn't after the monster?
134,NATASHA,Not that he's told me.
135,BRUCE,And he tells you everything?
136,NATASHA,"Talk to Fury, he needs you on this."
137,BRUCE,He needs me in a cage?
138,NATASHA,No one's gonna put you in a...
139,BRUCE,STOP LYING TO ME!
140,BRUCE,"I'm sorry, that was mean. I just wanted to see what you'd do. Why don't we do this the easy way, where you don't use that, and the other guy doesn't make a mess? Okay? Natasha..."
141,NATASHA,Stand down. We're good here.
142,BRUCE,Just you and me?
143,COUNCIL MEMBER 1,"This is out of line, Director. You're dealing with forces you can't control."
144,FURY,"You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight? Did you feel an overabundance of control?"
145,COUNCIL MEMBER 1,You saying that this Asgard has declared war on our planet?
146,FURY,"Not Asgard, Loki."
147,COUNCIL MEMBER 2,He can't be working alone. What about the other one? His brother.
148,FURY,"Our intelligence says, Thor is not a hostile. But he's worlds away, we can't depend on him to help. It's up to us."
149,COUNCIL MEMBER 1,"Which is why you should be focusing on phase 2, it was designed for exactly..."
150,FURY,"PHASE 2 isn't ready, our enemy is. We need a response team."
151,COUNCIL MEMBER 1,The Avengers Initiative was shut down.
152,FURY,This isn't about The Avengers.
153,COUNCIL MEMBER 1,We're running the world's greatest covert security network and you're gonna leave the fate of human race to a handful of freaks.
154,FURY,"I'm not leaving anything to anyone. We need a response team. These people maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need."
155,COUNCIL MEMBER 2,You believe?
156,COUNCIL MEMBER 1,"War isn't won by sentiment, Director."
157,FURY,"No, it's won by soldiers."
158,STEVE,There's not enough time! I gotta put her in the water!
159,PEGGY CARTER,You won't be alone.
160,SHIELD SCIENCETIST,Oh my god!
161,SHIELD SCIENCETIST,This guy is still alive!
162,FURY,Trouble sleeping?
163,STEVE,"I slept for seventy years, sir. I think I've had my fill."
164,FURY,"Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world."
165,STEVE,"I went under, the world was at war, I wake up, they say we won. They didn't say what we lost."
166,FURY,We've made some mistakes along the way. Some very recently.
167,STEVE,"You here with a mission, sir?"
168,FURY,I am.
169,STEVE,Trying to get me back in the world?
170,FURY,Trying to save it.
171,STEVE,Hydra's secret weapon.
172,FURY,"Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you. He thought what we think, the Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That's something the world sorely needs."
173,STEVE,Who took it from you?
174,FURY,He's called Loki. He's not from around here. There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know.
175,STEVE,"At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me."
176,FURY,Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a debriefing package waiting for you back at your apartment.
177,FURY,Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now?
178,STEVE,You should have left it in the ocean.
179,TONY,You're good on this end. The rest is up to you.
180,PEPPER POTTS,You disconnected the transition lines? Are we off the grid?
181,TONY,Stark Tower is about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy.
182,PEPPER,"Wow. So maybe our reactor takes over, and it actually works?"
183,TONY,I assume. Light her up.
184,PEPPER,How does it look?
185,TONY,"Like Christmas, but with more... me."
186,TONY,"Pepper, you're killing me. Remember the moment? Enjoy the moment."
187,PEPPER,Then get in here and I will.
188,JARVIS,"Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the line."
189,TONY,I'm not in. I'm actually out.
190,JARVIS,"Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting."
191,TONY,"Grow a spine, Jarvis. I got a date."
192,PEPPER,Levels are holding steady... I think.
193,TONY,"Of course they are, I was directly involved. Which brings me to my next question: how does it feel to be a genius?"
194,PEPPER,"Well, ha, I really wouldn't know now, would I?"
195,TONY,What do you mean? All this came from you.
196,PEPPER,No. All this came from that.
197,TONY,"Give yourself some credit, please. Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself... twelve percent of the credit."
198,PEPPER,Twelve percent?
199,TONY,An argument can be made for fifteen.
200,PEPPER,Twelve percent? For my baby?
201,TONY,"Well, I did do all the heavy lifting. Literally, I lifted the heavy things. And sorry, but the security snafu? That was on you."
202,PEPPER,Oooooh.
203,TONY,My private elevator...
204,PEPPER,You mean our elevator?
205,TONY,"Was steaming with sweaty workmen. I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later, aren't I?"
206,PEPPER,Not gonna be that subtle.
207,TONY,I'll tell you what. Next building's gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.
208,PEPPER,On the lease.
209,TONY,"Call your mom, can you bunk over?"
210,JARVIS,"Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid my protocols are being overwritten."
211,COULSON,"Stark, we need to talk."
212,TONY,"You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark, please leave a message."
213,COULSON,This is urgent.
214,TONY,Then leave it urgently.  That's on you.
215,COULSON,Mr. Stark
216,PEPPER,Phil! Come in.
217,TONY,"Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent."
218,PEPPER,"Come on in, we're celebrating."
219,COULSON,I can't stay
220,TONY,Which is why he can't stay.
221,COULSON,We need you to look this over.  Soon as possible.
222,TONY,I don't like being handed things.
223,PEPPER,"That's alright, 'cause I love to be handed things. So, let's trade.  Thank you."
224,TONY,Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday.
225,COULSON,This isn't a consultation.
226,PEPPER,Is this about The Avengers? Which I...I know nothing about.
227,TONY,"The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought. And I didn't even qualify."
228,PEPPER,I didn't know that either.
229,TONY,"Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed, don't play well with others."
230,PEPPER,That I did know.
231,COULSON,This isn't about personality profiles anymore.
232,TONY,"Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute?"
233,TONY,"You know, I thought we were having a moment."
234,PEPPER,"I was having twelve percent of a moment. This seems serious, Phil's pretty shaken."
235,TONY,How did you notice? Why is he Phil?
236,PEPPER,What is all of this?
237,TONY,"This is, uh...  This."
238,PEPPER,I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight.
239,TONY,Tomorrow.
240,PEPPER,You've got homework. You've got a lot of homework.
241,TONY,"Well, what if I didn't?"
242,PEPPER,If you didn't?
243,TONY,Yeah.
244,PEPPER,You mean if you finished?
245,TONY,Square deal. It's the last date.
246,PEPPER,Work hard.
247,PILOT,"We're about forty minutes out from base, sir."
248,STEVE,"So, this Doctor Banner was trying to replicate the serum that was used on me?"
249,COULSON,A lot of people were. You were the world's first superhero. Banner thought gamma radiation might hold the key to unlocking Erskine's original formula.
250,STEVE,"Didn't really go his way, did it?"
251,COULSON,"Not so much. When he's not that thing though, guy's like a Stephen Hawking.  I mean, I was... I was present while you were unconscious from the ice. You know, it's really, it's just a... just a huge honor to have you on board."
252,STEVE,"Well, I hope I'm the man for the job."
253,COULSON,"Oh, you are. Absolutely. Uh... we've made some modifications to the uniform. I had a little design input."
254,STEVE,The uniform? Aren't the stars and stripes a little... old fashioned?
255,COULSON,"With everything that's happening, the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old fashioned."
256,THE OTHER,The Chitauri grow restless
257,LOKI,Let them go at themselves. I will lead them into glorious battle.
258,THE OTHER,Battle? Against the meager might of Earth?
259,LOKI,"Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is as formidable as you claim."
260,THE OTHER,"You question us? You question him? He who put the scepter in your hand, who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose when you were cast out, defeated?"
261,LOKI,I was a king! The rightful kind of Asgard! Betrayed!
262,THE OTHER,"Your ambition is little, born of childish need. We look beyond the Earth to greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil."
263,LOKI,"You don't have the Tesseract yet.  I don't threaten, but until I open the doors, until your force is mine to command, you are but words."
264,THE OTHER,"You will have your war, Asgardian. If you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from us, there will be no realm, no barren moon, no crevice where he can't find you. You think you know pain? He will make you long for something as sweet as pain."
265,COULSON,"Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers."
266,STEVE,Ma'am?
267,NATASHA,Hi.  They need you on the bridge. They're starting the face-trace.
268,COULSON,See you there.
269,NATASHA,"It was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice. I thought Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?"
270,STEVE,Trading cards?
271,NATASHA,"They're vintage, he's very proud."
272,STEVE,Dr. Banner.
273,BRUCE,"Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be coming."
274,STEVE,Word is you can find the cube.
275,BRUCE,Is that the only word on me?
276,STEVE,Only word I care about.
277,BRUCE,"It must be strange for you, all of this."
278,STEVE,"Well, this is actually kind of familiar."
279,NATASHA,"Gentlemen, you might want to step inside in a minute. It's gonna get a little hard to breath."
280,STEVE,Is this a submarine?
281,BRUCE,"Really? They wanted me in a submerged, pressurized metal container?"
282,BRUCE,"Oh, no. This is much worse."
283,HILL,"We're at lock, sir."
284,FURY,Good. Let's vanish.
285,FURY,"Gentlemen.  Doctor, thank you for coming."
286,BRUCE,"Thanks for asking nicely. So, uh... how long am I staying?"
287,FURY,"Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you're in the clear."
288,BRUCE,Where are you with that?
289,COULSON,"We're sweeping every wirelessly accessible camera on the planet. Cellphones, laptops. If it's connected to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for us."
290,NATASHA,That's still not gonna find them in time.
291,BRUCE,You have to narrow the field. How many spectrometers do you have access to?
292,FURY,How many are there?
293,BRUCE,"Call every lab you know, tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll rough out a tracking algorithm based on cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places. Do you have somewhere for me to work?"
294,FURY,"Agent Romanoff, would you show Dr. Banner to his laboratory, please."
295,NATASHA,"You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys."
296,SELVIG,Put it over there!  Where did you find all these people?
297,CLINT,"SHIELD has not shortage of enemies, Doctor. . Is this the stuff you need?"
298,SELVIG,"Yeah, iridium. It's found in meteorites, it forms anti-protons. It's very hard to get hold of."
299,CLINT,Especially if SHIELD knows you need it.
300,SELVIG,"Well, I didn't know!  Hey! The Tesseract is showing me so much. It's more than just knowledge, it's... truth."
301,LOKI,"I know. What did it show you, Agent Barton?"
302,CLINT,My next target.
303,LOKI,Tell me what you need.
304,CLINT,I'll need a distraction.  And an eyeball.
305,COULSON,"I mean, if it's not too much trouble."
306,STEVE,"No, no. It's fine."
307,COULSON,"It's a vintage set. It took me a couple of years to collect them all. Near mint, slight foxing around the edges, but..."
308,AGENT JASPER SITWELL,"We got a hit. Sixty-seven percent match. Weight, cross match, seventy-nine percent."
309,AGENT PHIL COULSON,Location?
310,SITWELL,"Stuttgart, Germany. 28, Konigstrasse. He's not exactly hiding."
311,FURY,"Captain, you're up."
312,LOKI,"Kneel before me.  Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It's the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel."
313,ELDER GERMAN MAN,Not to men like you.
314,LOKI,There are no men like me.
315,ELDER GERMAN MAN,There are always men like you.
316,LOKI,"Look to your elder, people. Let him be an example."
317,CAPTAIN AMERICA,"You know, the last time I was in Germany and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing."
318,LOKI,The soldier. A man out of time.
319,CAPTAIN AMERICA,I'm not the one who's out of time.
320,NATASHA,"Loki, drop the weapon and stand down."
321,LOKI,Kneel.
322,CAPTAIN AMERICA,Not today!
323,NATASHA,This guy's all over the place.
324,IRON MAN,"Agent Romanoff, did you miss me?  Make your move, Reindeer Games."
325,IRON MAN,Good move.
326,CAPTAIN AMERICA,Mr. Stark.
327,IRON MAN,Captain.
328,NICK FURY,Said anything?
329,NATASHA,Not a word.
330,NICK FURY,Just get him here. We're low on time.
331,STEVE,I don't like it.
332,TONY,What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?
333,STEVE,I don't remember it being ever that easy. This guy packs a wallop.
334,TONY,"Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow. What's your thing? Pilates?"
335,STEVE,What?
336,TONY,"It's like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple things, you know, doing time as a Capsicle."
337,STEVE,Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.
338,TONY,"Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you."
339,NATASHA,Where's this coming from?
340,STEVE,What's the matter? Scared of a little lightning?
341,LOKI,I'm not overly fond of what follows.
342,IRON MAN,Now there's that guy.
343,NATASHA,Another Asgardian?
344,CAPTAIN AMERICA,Think the guy's a friendly?
345,IRON MAN,"Doesn't matter. If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost. Tony turns and gets ready to jump off the jet to chase after Thor."
346,CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Stark, we need a plan of attack!"
347,IRON MAN,I have a plan. Attack.
348,NATASHA,"I'd sit this one out, Cap."
349,CAPTAIN AMERICA,I don't see how I can.
350,NATASHA,"These guys come from legends, they're basically gods."
351,CAPTAIN AMERICA,"There's only one God, ma'am. And I'm  pretty sure he doesn't dress like that."
352,THOR,Where is the Tesseract?
353,LOKI,I missed you too.
354,THOR,Do I look to be in a gaming mood?!
355,LOKI,"Oh, you should thank me. With the Bifrost gone how much dark energy did the Allfather have to muster to conjure you here? Your precious Earth."
356,THOR,I thought you died.
357,LOKI,Did you mourn?
358,THOR,We all did. Our father...
359,LOKI,"Your father. He did tell you my true  parentage, did he not? Thor lets go Loki, who walks away from Thor, causing an even  bigger wedge between them."
360,THOR,"We were raised together, we played together, we fought together. Do you remember none of that?"
361,LOKI,I remember a shadow. Living in the  shade of your greatness. I remember you tossing me into an abyss. I was and should be king!
362,THOR,"So you take the world I love as  recompense for your imagined slights.  No, the Earth is under my protection,  Loki."
363,LOKI,"And you're doing a marvelous job with that. The humans slaughter each other in droves, while you idly threat. I  mean to rule them. And why should I not?"
364,THOR,You think yourself above them.
365,LOKI,"Well, yes."
366,THOR,"Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother. Throne would suit you ill. Angrily, Loki shoves his brother to the side. He walks back up  to the ledge. Turns around."
367,LOKI,"I've seen worlds you've never known about! I have grown, Odinson, in my exile! I have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when I wield it..."
368,THOR,Who showed you this power? Who controls the would-be-king?
369,LOKI,I am a king!
370,THOR,Not here! You give up the Tesseract!  You give up this poisonous dream! You come home.
371,LOKI,"I don't have it. You need the cube to bring me home, but I've sent it off I know not where."
372,THOR,"You listen well, brother. I..."
373,LOKI,I'm listening.
374,THOR,Do not touch me again!
375,TONY,Then don't take my stuff.
376,THOR,You have no idea what you're dealing with.
377,TONY,Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother know you weareth her drapes?
378,THOR,"This is beyond you, metal man. Loki will face Asgardian justice!"
379,TONY,"He gives up the Cube, he's all yours.  Until then, stay out of my way...  tourist.  The IRON MAN helmet clamps up and he walks away. In one quick  move, Thor pulls Mjölnir, throws it, and KNOCKS IRON MAN clear across into a tree."
380,TONY,Okay.
381,JARVIS,Power at 400% capacity.
382,TONY,How about that?
383,CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Hey! That's enough!    Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here."
384,THOR,I've come here to put an end to Loki's schemes!
385,CAPTAIN AMERICA,Then prove it! Put the hammer down.
386,IRON MAN,"Um, yeah, no! Bad call! He loves his hammer!"
387,THOR,You want me to put the hammer down?
388,CAPTAIN AMERICA,Are we done here?
389,NICK FURY,"In case it's unclear. You try to escape. You so much as scratch that glass.  Fury presses a button which OPENS UP a HATCH underneath Loki's  cell. Loki peers as much as he can from the glass. Without seeing, the sounds of GUSTING WIND would make man shit his pants. Not a god, though."
390,LOKI,"It's an impressive cage. Not built, I  think, for me."
391,NICK FURY,"Well, you let me know if Real Power  wants a magazine or something."
392,THOR,"He has an army called the Chitauri.  They're not of Asgard or any world  known. He means to lead them against  your people. They will win him the  earth. In return, I suspect, for the Tesseract."
393,STEVE,An army? From outer space?
394,The Other,"Humans. They are not the cowering wretches we were promised. They stand. They are unruly, and therefore cannot be ruled."
395,The Other,To challenge them is to court...Death.
