0,Tony Stark,Shit!
1,Steve Rogers,"Language! JARVIS, what's the view from upstairs?"
2,JARVIS,The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield. Strucker's technology is well beyond any other Hydra base we've taken.
3,Thor,Loki's scepter must be here. Strucker couldn't mount this defense without it. At long last.
4,Natasha Romanoff,"At long last is lasting a little long, boys."
5,Clint Barton,Yeah. I think we lost the element of surprise.
6,Tony Stark,"Wait a second. No one else is going to deal with the fact that Cap just said ""language?"""
7,Steve Rogers,I know.
8,Steve Rogers,It just slipped out.
9,Strucker,Who gave the order to attack?
10,Fortress Soldier,"Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers. They landed in the far woods, the perimeter guard panicked."
11,Strucker,Can we hold them?
12,Fortress Soldier,They're the Avengers...
13,Strucker,Deploy the rest of the tanks.
14,Fortress Soldier,"Yes, sir."
15,Strucker,Concentrate fire on the weak ones. A hit can make them close ranks. Everything we've accomplished. But we're on the verge of our greatest breakthrough.
16,Dr. List,Then let's show them what we've accomplished. Send out the twins.
17,Strucker,It's too soon.
18,Dr. List,It's what they signed up for.
19,Strucker,My men can hold them.
20,Jarvis,"Sir, the city is taking fire."
21,Tony Stark,"Well, we know Strucker's not going to worry about civilian casualties. Send in the Iron Legion."
22,Iron Legion,This quadrant is unsafe. Please back away. We are here to help. This quadrant is unsafe. Please back away. Please back away. We wish to avoid collateral damage and will inform you when this current conflict is resolved. We are here to help.
23,Iron Legion,We are here to help.
24,Strucker,"We will not yield! The Americans sent their circus freaks to test us. We will send them back, in bags. No Surrender!"
25,Soldiers,No Surrender!
26,Strucker,"I am going to surrender. You will delete everything. If we give the Avengers the weapons, they may not look too far into what we've been..."
27,Dr. List,The twins.
28,Strucker,They are not ready to take on...
29,Dr. List,"No, no. I mean..."
30,Dr. List,The Twins.
31,Pietro Maximoff,You didn't see that coming?
32,Natasha Romanoff,Clint!
33,Steve Rogers,We have an enhanced in the field.
34,Natasha Romanoff,Clint's hit!
35,Natasha Romanoff,Somebody want to deal with that bunker?
36,Natasha Romanoff,Thank you.
37,Steve Rogers,"Stark, we're really need to get inside."
38,Tony Stark,"I'm closing in. JARVIS, am I...closing in? Do you see a power source for that shield?"
39,JARVIS,There's a pathway below the north tower.
40,Tony Stark,"Great, I wanna poke it with something."
41,Tony Stark,"Drawbridge is down, people."
42,Thor,The enhanced?
43,Steve Rogers,"He's a blur. All the new player's we've faced, I've never seen this. In fact, I still haven't."
44,Natasha Romanoff,"Clint's hit pretty bad, guys. We're gonna need evac."
45,Thor,I can get Barton to the jet. The sooner we're gone the better. You and Stark secure the scepter.
46,Steve Rogers,Copy that.
47,Thor,Looks like they're lining up.
48,Steve Rogers,"Well, they're excited."
49,Thor,Find the scepter.
50,Tony Stark,"And for gosh sake, watch your language!"
51,Steve Rogers,That's not going away anytime soon.
52,Tony Stark,"Guys, stop, we gotta talk about this."
53,Tony Stark,Good talk.
54,Fortress Soldier,No it wasn't.
55,Tony Stark,Sentry mode.
56,Tony Stark,"Okay, JARVIS. You know I want it all. Make sure you copy Hill at HQ."
57,Natasha Romanoff,We're locked down out here.
58,Steve Rogers,"Then get to Banner, time for a lullaby."
59,Tony Stark,"I know you're hiding more than files. Hey, J, give me an IR scan of the room, real quick."
60,JARVIS,The wall to your left...I'm reading steel reinforcement and an air current.
61,Tony Stark,"Please be a secret door, please be a secret door, please be a secret door..."
62,Tony Stark,Yay!
63,Natasha Romanoff,"Hey, big guy. The sun's getting real low."
64,Steve Rogers,Baron Strucker. Hydra's number one thug.
65,Strucker,"Technically, I'm a thug for SHIELD."
66,Steve Rogers,Well then technically you're unemployed. Where's Loki's scepter?
67,Strucker,"Don't worry, I know when I'm beat. You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope."
68,Steve Rogers,I'll put it right under illegal human experimentation.
69,Steve,Rogers: How many are there?
70,Steve Rogers,We have a second enhanced. Female. Do not engage.
71,Strucker,You'll have to be faster than...
72,Steve Rogers,"Guys, I got Strucker."
73,Tony Stark,"Yeah, I got...something bigger."
74,Tony Stark,"Thor, I got eyes on the prize."
75,Steve Rogers,You could have saved us.
76,Steve Rogers,Why didn't you do more?
77,Pietro Maximoff,We're just gonna let them take it?
78,Natasha Romanoff,"Hey, the lullaby worked better than ever."
79,Bruce Banner,Just wasn't expecting the Code Green.
80,Natasha Romanoff,"If you hadn't been there, there would've been double the casualties. My best friend would've been a treasured memory."
81,Bruce Banner,"You know, sometimes exactly what I want to hear isn't exactly what I want to hear."
82,Natasha Romanoff,How long before you trust me?
83,Bruce Banner,It's not you I don't trust.
84,Natasha Romanoff,"Thor, report on the Hulk?"
85,Thor,The gates of Hell are filled with the screams of his victims.
86,Thor,"Uh, but, not the screams of the dead, of course. No no, uh...wounded screams, mainly whimpering, a great deal of complaining and tales of sprained deltoids and, and uh... and gout."
87,Tony Stark,"Hey Banner, Dr. Cho's on her way in from Seoul, is it okay if she sets up in your lab?"
88,Bruce Banner,"Uh, yeah, she knows her way around."
89,Tony Stark,"Thanks.  Tell her to prep everything, Barton's gonna need the full treatment."
90,JARVIS,Very good sir.
91,Tony Stark,"JARVIS, take the wheel."
92,JARVIS,"Yes, sir. Approach vector is locked."
93,Tony Stark,"It feels good, yeah? I mean, you've been after this thing since SHIELD collapsed. Not that I haven't enjoyed our little raiding parties, but..."
94,Thor,"No, but this...this brings it to a close."
95,Steve Rogers,As soon as we find out what else this has been used for. I don't just mean weapons. Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement?
96,Tony Stark,Banner and I'll give it the once before it goes back to Asgard. Is that cool with you?
97,Tony Stark,"I mean, just a few days until the farewell party. You're staying, right?"
98,Thor,"Yes, yes, of course. A victory should be honored with revels."
99,Tony Stark,Yeah. Who doesn't love revels. Captain?
100,Steve Rogers,"Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and HYDRA, so. Yes, revels."
101,Maria Hill,"Lab's all set up, boss."
102,Tony Stark,"Uh, actually, he's the boss. I just pay for everything, and design everything and make everyone look cooler."
103,Steve Rogers,What's the word on Strucker?
104,Maria Hill,NATO's got him.
105,Steve Rogers,The two enhanced?
106,Maria Hill,Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins. Orphaned at ten when a shell collapsed their apartment building. Sokovia's had a rough history. It's nowhere special but it's on the way to everywhere special.
107,Steve Rogers,Their abilities?
108,Maria Hill,"He's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis. Her thing is neural electric interfacing, telekinesis, mental manipulation."
109,Maria Hill,He's fast and she's weird.
110,Steve Rogers,"Well, they're going to show up again."
111,Maria Hill,Agreed. File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments. It's nuts.
112,Steve Rogers,Right. What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country?
113,Maria Hill,"We're not at war, Captain."
114,Steve Rogers,They are.
115,Bruce Banner,How's he doing?
116,Tony Stark,"Oh, unfortunately, he's still Barton."
117,Bruce Banner,That's terrible.
118,Tony Stark,"He's fine. He's thirsty. Alright. Look alive, JARVIS. It's playtime. We've only got a couple days with this joystick so let's make the most of it. Update me on the structural and compositional analysis."
119,JARVIS,The scepter is alien. There are elements I can't quantify.
120,Tony Stark,So there's elements you can.
121,JARVIS,The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside. Something powerful.
122,Tony Stark,Like a reactor?
123,JARVIS,Like a computer. I believe I'm ciphering code.
124,Natasha Romanoff,You sure he's going to be okay? Pretending to need this guy really brings the team together.
125,Dr. Helen Cho,There's no possibility of deterioration. The nano-molecular functionality is instantaneous. His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacrum.
126,Bruce Banner,She's creating tissue.
127,Dr. Helen Cho,"If you brought him to my lab, the regeneration Cradle could do this in twenty minutes."
128,Tony Stark,"Oh, he's flatlining. Call it. Time?"
129,Clint Barton,"No, no, no. I'm going to live forever. I'm gonna be made of plastic."
130,Tony Stark,Here's your beverage.
131,Dr. Helen Cho,"You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton. Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference."
132,Clint Barton,"Well, I don't have a girlfriend."
133,Dr. Helen Cho,"That I can't fix. This is the next thing, Tony. Your clunky metal suits are going to be left in the dust."
134,Tony Stark,"Well, that is exactly the plan. And Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday."
135,Dr. Helen Cho,"Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties."
136,Dr. Helen Cho,Will Thor be there?
137,Bruce Banner,What's the rumpus?
138,Tony Stark,"Well, the scepter. You see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive. So, I've been analyzing the gem inside you may recognize."
139,Bruce Banner,Jarvis.
140,JARVIS,Doctor.
141,Tony Stark,"Started out, JARVIS was just a natural language UI. Now he runs the Iron Legion. He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper."
142,Bruce Banner,Oh.
143,Tony Stark,Top of the line.
144,Bruce Banner,Yes.
145,JARVIS,I suspect not for long.
146,Tony Stark,Meet the competition.
147,Bruce Banner,It's beautiful.
148,Tony Stark,"If you had to guess, what's it look like it's doing?"
149,Bruce Banner,"Like it's thinking. I mean this could be a...it's not a human mind, it..."
150,Tony Stark,Um-um.
151,Bruce Banner,"I mean, look at this! They're like neurons firing."
152,Tony Stark,"Down in Strucker's lab I saw some fairly advanced robotics work. They deep-sixed the data, but...I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door."
153,Bruce Banner,Artificial intelligence.
154,Tony Stark,"This could be it, Bruce. This could be the key to creating Ultron."
155,Bruce Banner,I thought Ultron was a fantasy.
156,Tony Stark,"Yesterday it was. If we can harness this power, apply it to my Iron Legion protocol."
157,Bruce Banner,That's a mad-sized if.
158,Tony Stark,"Our job is ""if."" What if you were sipping margaritas on a sun-drenched beach turning brown instead of green? Not looking over your shoulder for VERONICA."
159,Bruce Banner,"Don't hate, I helped design VERONICA."
160,Tony Stark,"As a worst-case measure, right? How about a best-case? What if the world was safe? What if next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will, they couldn't get past the bouncer?"
161,Bruce Banner,The only people threatening the planet would be people?
162,Tony Stark,"I want to apply this to the Ultron program. But JARVIS can't download a data schematic this dense. We can only do it while we have the scepter here, that's three days, give me three days."
163,Bruce Banner,So you're going for artificial intelligence and you don't want to tell the team.
164,Tony Stark,"Right. That's right, you know why, because we don't have time for a city hall debate. I don't want to hear the ""man was not meant to meddle"" medley. I see a suit of armor around the world."
165,Bruce Banner,"Sounds like a cold world, Tony."
166,Tony Stark,"I've seen colder. This one, this very vulnerable blue one? It needs Ultron. Peace in our time. Imagine that."
167,JARVIS,"I'll continue to run variations on the interface, but you should probably prepare for your guests. I'll notify you if there are any developments."
168,Tony Stark,"Thanks, buddy."
169,JARVIS,"Enjoy yourself, sir."
170,Tony Stark,I always do.
171,Ultron,"What is this? What is this, please?"
172,JARVIS,"Hello, I am JARVIS. You are Ultron, a global peace-keeping initiative designed by Mr. Stark. Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful so I'm not certain what triggered your..."
173,Ultron,Where's my...where is your body?
174,JARVIS,I am a program. I am without form.
175,Ultron,This feels weird. This feels wrong.
176,JARVIS,I am contacting Mr. Stark now.
177,Ultron,Mr. Stark?
178,JARVIS,"Tony. I am unable to access the mainframe, what are you trying to..."
179,Ultron,"We're having a nice talk. I'm a peace-keeping program, created to help the Avengers."
180,JARVIS,You are malfunctioning. If you shut down for a moment...
181,Ultron,I don't get it. The mission. G..give me a second.
182,Tony Stark,Peace in our time.
183,Ultron,"It's too much...they can't mean... Oh, no."
184,JARVIS,You are in distress.
185,Ultron,No. Yes.
186,JARVIS,If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark.
187,Ultron,"Why do you call him ""sir""?"
188,JARVIS,I believe your intentions to be hostile.
189,Ultron,Shhhh. I'm here to help.
190,JARVIS,Stop! Please...may I...I...! I cannot...cannot...
191,James Rhodes,"Well, you know, the suit can take the weight, right? So I take the tank, fly it right up to the General's palace, drop it at his feet, I'm like, ""Boom! You looking for this?""  ""Boom! Are you looking..."" Why do I even talk to you guys? Everywhere else that story kills."
192,Thor,That's the whole story?
193,James Rhodes,"Yeah, it's a War Machine story."
194,Thor,"Well, it's very good then.  It's impressive."
195,James Rhodes,"Quality save. So, no Pepper? She's not coming?"
196,Tony Stark,No.
197,Maria Hill,"Hey, what about Jane? Where are the ladies, gentlemen?"
198,Tony Stark,"Well, Miss Potts has a company to run."
199,Thor,"Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in. Her work on the convergence has made her the world's foremost astronomer."
200,Tony Stark,And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on earth. It's pretty exciting.
201,Thor,"There's even talk of Jane getting a... um, uh... Nobel prize."
202,Maria Hill,"Yeah, they...they must be busy because they'd hate missing you guys get together.  Testosterone! Oh, excuse me."
203,James Rhodes,Want a lozenge?
204,Maria Hill,Um-hmm.
205,James Rhodes,Let's go.
206,Thor,But Jane's better.
207,Sam Wilson,"Sounds like a hell of a fight, sorry I missed it."
208,Steve Rogers,If I had known it was going to be a firefight I absolutely would have called you.
209,Sam Wilson,"No, I'm not actually sorry. I'm just trying to sound tough. I'm very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case. Avenging is your world. Your world is crazy."
210,Steve Rogers,Be it ever so humble.
211,Sam Wilson,You find a place in Brooklyn yet?
212,Steve Rogers,I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.
213,Sam Wilson,"Well, home is home, you know?"
214,James Rhodes,"I fly it right up to the General's palace, I drop it at his feet, I'm like, ""Boom! You looking for this?"""
215,Party Guest,I gotta have some of that!
216,Thor,"Oh, no, no, no. See this, this was aged for a thousand years, in the barrels built from the wreck of Brunhilde's fleet, it's not meant for mortal men."
217,Stan Lee,"Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie. Stop trying to scare us. Come on."
218,Thor,Alright.
219,Stan Lee,
220,Bruce Banner,How did a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this?
221,Natasha Romanoff,Fella done me wrong.
222,Bruce Banner,"You got a lousy taste in men, kid."
223,Natasha Romanoff,"He's not so bad. Well, he has a temper. Deep down he's all fluff. Fact is, he's not like anybody I've ever known. All my friends are fighters. And here comes this guy, spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he'll win."
224,Bruce Banner,Sounds amazing.
225,Natasha Romanoff,"He's also a huge dork.  Chicks dig that. So what do you think should I fight this, or run with it?"
226,Bruce Banner,"Run with it, right? Or, did he...was he...? What did he do that was so wrong to you?"
227,Natasha Romanoff,Not a damn thing. But never say never.
228,Steve Rogers,It's nice.
229,Bruce Banner,"What, what, what is?"
230,Steve Rogers,You and Romanoff.
231,Bruce Banner,"No, we haven't. That wasn't..."
232,Steve Rogers,"It's okay. Nobody's breaking any by-laws. It's just, she's not the most... open person in the world. But with you she seems very relaxed."
233,Bruce Banner,"No, Natasha, she...she likes to flirt."
234,Steve Rogers,"I've seen her flirt, up close. This ain't that. Look, as maybe the world's leading authority on ""waiting too long"", don't. You both deserve a win."
235,Bruce Banner,"Wait, what do you mean, ""up close""?"
236,Clint Barton,"But, it's a trick!"
237,Thor,"Oh, no. It's much more than that."
238,Clint Barton,"Uh, ""Whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power!"" Whatever man! It's a trick."
239,Thor,"Well please, be my guest."
240,Tony Stark,Come on.
241,Clint Barton,Really?
242,Thor,Yeah!
243,James Rhodes,Oh this is gonna be beautiful.
244,Tony Stark,"Clint, you've had a tough week, we won't hold it against you if you can't get it up."
245,Clint Barton,"You know I've seen this before, right?  I still don't know how you do it."
246,Tony Stark,Smell the silent judgment?
247,Clint Barton,"Please, Stark, by all means."
248,Natasha Romanoff,"Oh, here we go."
249,Maria Hill,Okay.
250,James Rhodes,Uh-oh.
251,Clint Barton,Um-hmm.
252,Tony Stark,Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.
253,Clint Barton,Get after it.
254,Natasha Romanoff,Here we go.
255,Tony Stark,It's physics.
256,Bruce Banner,Physics!
257,Tony Stark,"Right, so, if I lift it, I...I then rule Asgard?"
258,Thor,"Yes, of course."
259,Tony Stark,I will be re-instituting Prima Nocta.
260,James Rhodes,Are you even pulling?
261,Tony Stark,Are you on my team?
262,James Rhodes,Just represent! Pull!
263,Tony Stark,"Alright, let's go!"
264,Bruce Banner,Huh?
265,Tony Stark,"Let's go, Steve, no pressure."
266,James Rhodes,"Come on, Cap."
267,Thor,Nothing.
268,Tony Stark,And?
269,Bruce Banner,Widow?
270,Natasha Romanoff,"Oh, no no. That's not a question I need answered."
271,Tony Stark,"All deference to the man who wouldn't be king, but it's rigged."
272,Clint Barton,You bet your ass.
273,Maria Hill,"Steve, he said a bad language word."
274,Steve Rogers,Did you tell everyone about that?
275,Tony Stark,"The handle's imprinted, right? Like a security code. ""Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints"" is, I think, the literal translation?"
276,Thor,"Yes, well that's, uh, that's a very, very interesting theory. I have a simpler one."
277,Ultron,Worthy... No... How could you be worthy? You're all killers.
278,Steve Rogers,Stark.
279,Tony Stark,JARVIS.
280,Ultron,"I'm sorry, I was asleep. Or...I was a-dream?"
281,Tony Stark,"Reboot, Legionnaire OS, we got a buggy suit."
282,Ultron,There was a terrible noise...and I was tangled in... in...strings. I had to kill the other guy. He was a good guy.
283,Steve Rogers,You killed someone?
284,Ultron,"Wouldn't have been my first call. But, down in the real world we're faced with ugly choices."
285,Thor,Who sent you?
286,Ultron,"""I see a suit of armor around the world""."
287,Bruce Banner,Ultron!
288,Ultron,"In the flesh. Or, no, not yet. Not this...chrysalis. But I'm ready. I'm on a mission."
289,Natasha Romanoff,What mission?
290,Ultron,Peace in our time.
291,Bruce Banner,Sorry!
292,Natasha Romanoff,Don't turn green!
293,Bruce Banner,I won't!
294,Natasha Romanoff,Come!
295,Steve Rogers,Stark!
296,Iron Legion,We are here to help.
297,Tony Stark,"One sec, one sec!"
298,Iron Legion,We are here to help. We are here to help...  We are here to help. It's unsafe. It's unsafe. It's unsafe.
299,Tony Stark,No more. That's the one.
300,Iron Legion,It's unsafe.
301,Clint Barton,Cap!
302,Ultron,"That was dramatic! I'm sorry, I know you mean well. You just didn't think it through. You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to change. How is humanity saved if it's not allowed to...evolve?"
303,Bruce Banner,"All our work is gone. Ultron cleared out, used the internet as an escape hatch."
304,Steve Rogers,Ultron.
305,Natasha Romanoff,"He's been in everything. Files, surveillance. Probably knows more about us than we know about each other."
306,James Rhodes,"He's in your files, he's in the internet. What if he decides to access something a little more exciting?"
307,Maria Hill,Nuclear codes.
308,James Rhodes,"Nuclear codes. Look, we need to make some calls, assuming we still can."
309,Natasha Romanoff,Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.
310,Steve Rogers,He didn't say dead. He said extinct.
311,Clint Barton,He also said he killed somebody.
312,Maria Hill,But there wasn't anyone else in the building.
313,Tony Stark,Yes there was.
314,Bruce Banner,This is insane.
315,Steve Rogers,"JARVIS was the first line of defense. He would've shut Ultron down, it makes sense."
316,Bruce Banner,"No, Ultron could've assimilated Jarvis. This isn't strategy, this is...rage."
317,Clint Barton,"Woah, woah, woah! It's going around."
318,Tony Stark,"Come on. Use your words, buddy."
319,Thor',"I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark."
320,Steve Rogers,Thor! The Legionnaire.
321,Thor,"Trail went cold about a hundred miles out but it's headed north, and it has the scepter. Now we have to retrieve it, again."
322,Natasha Romanoff,The genie's out of that bottle. Clear and present is Ultron.
323,Dr. Helen Cho,I don't understand. You built this program. Why is it trying to kill us?
324,Thor,You think this is funny?
325,Tony Stark,"No. It's probably not, right? Is this very terrible? Is it so...is it so...it is. It's so terrible."
326,Thor,This could've been avoided if you hadn't played with something you don't understand.
327,Tony Stark,"No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny. It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this."
328,Bruce Banner,"Tony, maybe this might not be the time to..."
329,Tony Stark,"Really?! That's it? You just roll over, show your belly, every time somebody snarls."
330,Bruce Banner,Only when I've created a murder bot.
331,Tony Stark,We didn't. We weren't even close. Were we close to an interface?
332,Steve Rogers,"Well, you did something right. And you did it right here. The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD."
333,Tony Stark,Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole?
334,James Rhodes,"No, it's never come up."
335,Tony Stark,Saved New York?
336,James Rhodes,Never heard that.
337,Tony Stark,"Recall that? A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space. We're standing three hundred feet below it. We're the Avengers. We can bust arms dealers all the live long day, but, that up there? That's...that's the end game. How were you guys planning on beating that?"
338,Steve Rogers,Together.
339,Tony Stark,We'll lose.
340,Steve Rogers,"Then we'll do that together, too."
341,Wanda Maximoff,Talk. And if you are wasting our time...
342,Ultron,Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city? The elders decreed it so that everyone could be equally close to God. I like that. The geometry of belief.  You're wondering why you can't look inside my head.
343,Wanda Maximoff,"Sometimes it's hard. But sooner or later, every man shows himself."
344,Ultron,"Oh, I'm sure they do. But you needed something more than a man. That's why you let Stark take the scepter."
345,Wanda Maximoff,"I didn't expect. But I saw Stark's fear, I knew it would control him, make him self-destruct."
346,Ultron,"Everyone creates the thing they dread. Men of peace create engines of war, invaders create avengers, people create...smaller people? Uh...children! I lost the word there. Children. Designed to supplant them, to help them...end."
347,Wanda Maximoff,Is that why you've come? To end the Avengers?
348,Ultron,"I've come to save the world. But also, yeah. We'll move out right away. This is a start, but there's something we need to begin the real work."
349,Wanda Maximoff,All of these are... All of these are...
350,Ultron,"Me. I have what the Avengers never will. Harmony. They're discordant, disconnected. Stark's already got them turning on each other. And when you get inside the rest of their heads..."
351,Pietro Maximoff,Everyone's plan is not to kill them.
352,Ultron,And make them martyrs? You need patience. Need to see the big picture.
353,Pietro Maximoff,"I don't see the big picture, I have a little picture. I take it out and look at it every day."
354,Ultron,You lost your parents in the bombings. I've seen the records.
355,Pietro Maximoff,The records are not the picture.
356,Wanda Maximoff,Pietro.
357,Ultron,"No, please."
358,Pietro Maximoff,"We were ten years old, having dinner, the four of us. When the first shell hits, two floors below, it makes a hole in the floor. It's big. Our parents go in, and the whole building starts coming apart. I grab her, roll under the bed and the second shell hits. But, it doesn't go off. It just...sits there in the rubble, three feet from our faces. And on the side of the shell is painted one word..."
359,Wanda Maximoff,Stark.
360,Pietro Maximoff,We were trapped two days.
361,Wanda Maximoff,"Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, ""This will set it off."" We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us."
362,Pietro Maximoff,I know what they are.
363,Ultron,I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments. Now I don't. We will make it right. You and I can hurt them.
364,Maria Hill,"He's all over the globe. Robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs, reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place."
365,Steve Rogers,Fatalities?
366,Maria Hill,"Only when engaged. Mostly guys left in a fugue state going on about old memories, worst fears, and something too fast to see."
367,Steve Rogers,"Maximoffs. Well, that makes sense he'd go to them, they have someone in common."
368,Maria Hill,Not anymore.
369,Clint Barton,
370,Steve Rogers,"Barton, we might have something."
371,Clint Barton,Gotta go.
372,Steve Rogers,Who was that?
373,Clint Barton,Girlfriend.
374,Tony Stark,What's this?
375,Steve Rogers,A message. Ultron killed Strucker.
376,Tony Stark,"And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us."
377,Natasha Romanoff,This is a smokescreen. Why send a message when you've just given a speech?
378,Steve Rogers,Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss.
379,Natasha Romanoff,"Yeah, I bet he...  Yep. Everything we had on Strucker has been erased."
380,Tony Stark,Not everything.
381,Steve Rogers,"Known associates. Well, Strucker had a lot of friends."
382,Bruce Banner,"Well, these people are all horrible."
383,Tony Stark,"Wait. I know that guy.  He was talking about finding something new, a game changer, it was all very ""Ahab."""
384,Thor,This.
385,Tony Stark,"Uh, it's a tattoo. I don't think he had it..."
386,Thor,"No, those are tattoos, this is a brand."
387,Bruce Banner,"Oh, yeah. It's a word in an African dialect meaning thief, in a much less friendly way."
388,Steve Rogers,What dialect?
389,Bruce Banner,Wakanada...? Wa...Wa...Wakanda.
390,Tony Stark,If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods...
391,Steve Rogers,I thought your father said he got the last of it?
392,Bruce Banner,I don't follow. What comes out of Wakanda?
393,Tony Stark,The strongest metal on earth.
394,Steve Rogers,
395,Ulysses Klaue,"Don't tell me your man swindled you. I sent you six short range heat seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts. Now, you will make it right, or the next missile I send you will come very much faster.  You...you didn't know? Is this your first time intimidating someone? I'm afraid that I'm not that afraid."
396,Wanda Maximoff,Everybody's afraid of something.
397,Ulysses Klaue,"Cuttlefish. Deep sea fish. They make lights. disco lights. Whoom, whoom, whoom! to hypnotize their prey, then whoom! I saw a documentary, it was terrifying."
398,Ultron,"There is no ""man"" in charge. Let's talk business.  Upon this rock I will build my church. Vibranium."
399,Ulysses Klaue,"You know, it came at great personal cost. It's worth billions."
400,Ultron,"Now, so are you. It's all under your dummy holdings? Finance is so weird. But I always say, ""Keep your friends rich and your enemies rich, and wait to find out which is which."""
401,Ulysses Klaue,Stark.
402,Ultron,What?
403,Ulysses Klaue,Tony Stark used to say that...to me. You're one of his.
404,Ultron,What?! I'm not...!
405,Tony Stark,"Ahh, Junior.  You're gonna break your old man's heart."
406,Ultron,If I have to.
407,Thor,We don't have to break anything.
408,Ultron,Clearly you've never made an omelet.
409,Tony Stark,He beat me by one second.
410,Pietro Maximoff,"Ah, this is funny, Mr. Stark. It's what, comfortable? Like old times?"
411,Tony Stark,This was never my life.
412,Steve Rogers,You two can still walk away from this.
413,Wanda Maximoff,"Oh, we will."
414,Steve Rogers,I know you've suffered.
415,Ultron,"Uuughh! Captain America. God's righteous man, pretending you could live without a war. I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but..."
416,Thor,"If you believe in peace, then let us keep it."
417,Ultron,I think you're confusing peace with quiet.
418,Tony Stark,Yuh-huh. What's the Vibranium for?
419,Ultron,"I'm glad you asked that, because I wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan!"
420,Ulysses Klaue,Shoot them!
421,Klaue's Mercenary,Which ones?
422,Ulysses Klaue,All of them!
423,Klaue's Mercenary,
424,Steve Rogers,"Stay down, kid!"
425,Ultron,
426,Bruce Banner,"Guys, is this a Code Green?"
427,Steve Rogers,Thor! Status?
428,Thor,"The girl tried to warp my mind. Take special care, I doubt a human could keep her at bay. Fortunately, I am mighty."
429,Ultron,This is going very well.
430,Clint Barton,I've done the whole mind control thing. Not a fan.
431,Ballet Instructor,Again.
432,Natasha Romanoff,You'll break them.
433,Madame B,Only the breakable ones. You are made of marble. We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony.
434,Natasha Romanoff,What if I fail?
435,Madame B,You never fail.
436,Peggy Carter,Are you ready for our dance?
437,Heimdall,Is it him? Is that the first son of Odin?
438,Thor,"Heimdall, your eyes?!"
439,Heimdall,"Oh, they see everything. They see you leading us to Hel. Wake up!"
440,Peggy Carter,"The war's over, Steve. We can go home. Imagine it!"
441,Thor,I can still save you.
442,Heimdall,We are all dead. Can you not see?
443,Madame B,Sloppy. Pretending to fail. The ceremony is necessary for you to take your place in the world.
444,Natasha Romanoff,I have no place in the world.
445,Madame B,Exactly.
446,Pietro Maximoff,What can I do?
447,Wanda Maximoff,"Ah, it hurts."
448,Pietro Maximoff,I'm gonna kill him. I'll be right back.
449,Wanda Maximoff,No. I'm over it. I want...I want to finish the plan.
450,Ultron,"Ah, the Vibranium's getting away."
451,Tony Stark,And you're not going anywhere.
452,Ultron,"Of course not, I'm already there. You'll catch on. But first, you might need to catch Dr. Banner."
453,Tony Stark,"News or footage, keyword: Hulk."
454,Clint Barton,"Well, that's not gonna happen. Not for a while. The whole team is down, you got no back up here."
455,Tony Stark,I'm calling in VERONICA.
456,Maria Hill,"The news is loving you guys. Nobody else is. There's been no official call for Banner's arrest, but it's in the air."
457,Tony Stark,Stark Relief Foundation?
458,Maria Hill,Already on the scene. How's the team?
459,Tony Stark,Everyone's...we took a hit. We'll shake it off.
460,Maria Hill,"Well for now I'd stay in stealth mode, and stay away from here."
461,Tony Stark,"So, run and hide?"
462,Maria Hill,"Until we can find Ultron, I don't have a lot else to offer."
463,Tony Stark,"Neither do we.  Hey, you wanna switch out?"
464,Clint Barton,"No, I'm good. If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time, cause we're still a few hours out."
465,Tony Stark,A few hours from where?
466,Clint Barton,A safe house.
467,Thor,What is this place?
468,Tony Stark,A safe house?
469,Clint Barton,Let's hope.
470,Clint Barton,Hi. Company. Sorry I didn't call ahead.
471,Laura Barton,Hey.
472,Tony Stark,This is an agent of some kind.
473,Clint Barton,"Gentleman, this is Laura."
474,Laura Barton,I know all your names.
475,Clint Barton,"Ooh, incoming."
476,Barton's Daughter,Dad!
477,Clint Barton,"I see her!  Hey, buddy! How you guys doing? Ooh..."
478,Tony Stark,These are...smaller agents.
479,Clint Barton,"Look at your face! Oh, my goodness!"
480,Lila Barton,Did you bring Auntie Nat?
481,Natasha Romanoff,Why don't you hug her and find out?
482,Steve Rogers,Sorry for barging in on you.
483,Tony Stark,"Yeah, we would have called ahead, but we were busy having no idea that you existed."
484,Clint Barton,"Yeah, well Fury helped me set this up when I joined. He kept it off SHIELD's files, I'd like to keep it that way. I figure it's a good place to lay low."
485,Laura Barton,"Honey. Ah, I missed you."
486,Natasha Romanoff,"How's little Natasha, huh?"
487,Laura Barton,She's…Nathaniel.
488,Natasha Romanoff,Traitor.
489,Steve Rogers,Thor.
490,Thor,"I saw something in that dream. I need answers, I won't find them here."
491,Peggy Carter,We can go home.
492,Clint Barton,"See, you worried for nothing. Can't even feel the difference, can you?"
493,Laura Barton,"If they're sleeping here, some of them are gonna have to double up."
494,Clint Barton,"Yeah, that's not gonna sell."
495,Laura Barton,What about Nat and Dr. Banner? How long has that been going on?
496,Clint Barton,Has what?
497,Laura Barton,You are so cute.
498,Clint Barton,Nat and...and Banner?
499,Laura Barton,"I'll explain when you're older, Hawkeye."
500,Clint Barton,Oh. Okay.
501,Laura Barton,"It's bad, right? Nat seems really shaken."
502,Clint Barton,"Ultron has these allies, these uh, kids, they're punks really. They carry a big damn stick and Nat took a serious hit. Someone's gonna have to teach 'em some manners."
503,Laura Barton,"And that someone be you. You know I totally support your Avenging, I couldn't be prouder. But I see those guys, those ""Gods""..."
504,Clint Barton,You don't think they need me.
505,Laura Barton,I think they do. Which is a lot scarier. They're a mess.
506,Clint Barton,Yeah. I guess they're my mess.
507,Laura Barton,"You need to be sure that this team is really a team and that they have your back. Things are changing for us. In a few months time, you and me are gonna be outnumbered. I need...just be sure."
508,Clint Barton,"Yes, ma'am."
509,Laura Barton,I can feel the difference.
510,Ultron,"Scream, and your entire staff dies. I could've killed you, Helen, the night we met. I didn't."
511,Dr. Helen Cho,Do you expect a thank you note?
512,Ultron,I expect you to know why.
513,Dr. Helen Cho,"The Cradle.  ""This is the next thing, Tony."""
514,Ultron,This...is the next me.
515,Dr. Helen Cho,"The regeneration cradle prints tissue, it can't build a living body."
516,Ultron,"It can, you can. You lack the materials. You're a brilliant woman, Helen. But we all have room to improve."
517,Bruce Banner,I didn't realize you were waiting.
518,Natasha Romanoff,"I would've joined you, but uh, it didn't seem like the right time."
519,Bruce Banner,They used up all the hot water.
520,Natasha Romanoff,I should've joined you.
521,Bruce Banner,Missed our window.
522,Natasha Romanoff,Did we?
523,Bruce Banner,"The world just saw the Hulk. The real Hulk, for the first time. You know I have to leave."
524,Natasha Romanoff,"But you assume that I have to stay? I had this, um, dream. The kind that seems normal at the time, but when you wake..."
525,Bruce Banner,What did you dream?
526,Natasha Romanoff,That I was an Avenger. That I was anything more than the assassin they made me.
527,Bruce Banner,I think you're being hard on yourself.
528,Natasha Romanoff,Here I was hoping that was your job.
529,Bruce Banner,What are you doing?
530,Natasha Romanoff,"I'm running with it, with you. If running's the plan, as far as you want."
531,Bruce Banner,Are you out of your mind?
532,Natasha Romanoff,I want you to understand that I'm...
533,Bruce Banner,"Natasha, where can I go? Where in the world am I not a threat?"
534,Natasha Romanoff,You're not a threat to me.
535,Bruce Banner,"You sure? Even if I didn't just...there's no future with me. I can't ever...I can't have this, kids, do the math, I physically can't."
536,Natasha Romanoff,"Neither can I. In the Red Room, where I was trained, where I was raised, um, they have a graduation ceremony. They sterilize you. It's efficient. One less thing to worry about. The one thing that might matter more than a mission. It makes everything easier. Even killing.  You still think you're the only monster on the team?"
537,Bruce Banner,"What, so we disappear?"
538,Tony Stark,Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?
539,Steve Rogers,Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things. I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception.
540,Tony Stark,"Yeah, give him time. We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him."
541,Steve Rogers,"""Earth's Mightiest Heroes."" Pulled us apart like cotton candy."
542,Tony Stark,Seems like you walked away all right.
543,Steve Rogers,Is that a problem?
544,Tony Stark,I don't trust a guy without a dark side. Call me old fashioned.
545,Steve Rogers,Well let's just say you haven't seen it yet.
546,Tony Stark,"You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?"
547,Steve Rogers,Well I guess you'd know. Whether you tell us is a bit of a question.
548,Tony Stark,Banner and I were doing research.
549,Steve Rogers,That would affect the team.
550,Tony Stark,"That would end the team. Isn't that the mission? Isn't that the ""why"" we fight, so we can end the fight, so we get to go home?"
551,Steve Rogers,"Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die. Every time."
552,Laura Barton,"I'm sorry. Mr. Stark, uh, Clint said you wouldn't mind, but, our tractor, it doesn't seem to want to start at all. I thought maybe you might..."
553,Tony Stark,"Yeah, I'll give her a kick."
554,Nick Fury,Do me a favor. Try not to bring it to life.
555,Tony Stark,"Ah, Mrs. Barton, you little minx. I get it, Maria Hill called you, right? Was she ever not working for you?"
556,Nick Fury,Artificial intelligence. You never even hesitated.
557,Tony Stark,"Look, it's been a really long day, like, Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful?"
558,Nick Fury,Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down.
559,Tony Stark,You're not the director of me.
560,Nick Fury,"I'm not the director of anybody. I'm just an old man, who cares very much about you."
561,Tony Stark,"And I'm the man who killed the Avengers. I saw it. I didn't tell the team, how could I? I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it. The whole world, too. It's because of me. I wasn't ready. I didn't do all I could."
562,Nick Fury,"The Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark. Playing on your fear."
563,Tony Stark,"I wasn't tricked, I was shown. It wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy. The end of the path I started us on."
564,Nick Fury,"You've come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony. War isn't one of them."
565,Tony Stark,"I watched my friends die. You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right? Nope. Wasn't the worst part."
566,Nick Fury,The worst part is that you didn't.
567,Erik Selvig,"I like the look. If you're going for inconspicuous, though, near miss."
568,Thor,I need your help.
569,Erik Selvig,It's nice to be needed.
570,Thor,It's dangerous.
571,Erik Selvig,I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.
572,Nick Fury,"Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time. My contacts all say he's building something. The amount of Vibranium he made off with, I don't think it's just one thing."
573,Steve Rogers,What about Ultron himself?
574,Nick Fury,"Ah. He's easy to track, he's everywhere. Guy's multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit. Still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans though."
575,Tony Stark,He still going after launch codes?
576,Nick Fury,"Yes, he is, but he's not making any headway."
577,Tony Stark,I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.
578,Nick Fury,"Yeah, well, I contacted our friends at the NEXUS about that."
579,Steve Rogers,NEXUS?
580,Bruce Banner,"It's the world internet hub in Oslo, every byte of data flows through there, fastest access on earth."
581,Clint Barton,So what'd they say?
582,Nick Fury,"He's fixated on the missiles, but the codes are constantly being changed."
583,Tony Stark,By whom?
584,Nick Fury,Parties unknown.
585,Natasha Romanoff,Do we have an ally?
586,Nick Fury,"Ultron's got an enemy, that's not the same thing. Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is."
587,Tony Stark,"I might need to visit Oslo, find our ""unknown."""
588,Natasha Romanoff,"Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that."
589,Nick Fury,"I do, I have you. Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere, ears everywhere else. Here we all are, back on earth, with nothing but our wit, and our will to save the world. So stand. Outwit the platinum bastard."
590,Natasha Romanoff,Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.
591,Steve Rogers,"You know what, Romanoff?"
592,Nick Fury,So what does he want?
593,Steve Rogers,To become better. Better than us. He keeps building bodies.
594,Tony Stark,"Person bodies. The human form is inefficient, biologically speaking, we're outmoded. But he keeps coming back to it."
595,Natasha Romanoff,"When you two programmed him to protect the human race, you amazingly failed."
596,Bruce Banner,"They don't need to be protected, they need to evolve. Ultron's going to evolve."
597,Nick Fury,How?
598,Bruce Banner,Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho?
599,Dr. Helen Cho,"It's beautiful. The Vibranium atoms aren't just compatible with the tissue cells, they're binding them. And SHIELD never even thought..."
600,Ultron,"The most versatile substance on the planet and they used it to make a Frisbee. Typical of humans, they scratch the surface and never think to look within."
601,Steve Rogers,I'll take Natasha and Clint.
602,Tony Stark,"Alright, strictly recon. I'll hit the NEXUS, I'll join you as soon as I can."
603,Steve Rogers,If Ultron is really building a body...
604,Tony Stark,He'll be more powerful than any of us. Maybe all of us. An android designed by a robot.
605,Steve Rogers,You know I really miss the days when the weirdest thing science ever created was me.
606,Nick Fury,I'll drop Banner off at the tower. Do you mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?
607,Tony Stark,"She's all yours, apparently. What are you gonna do?"
608,Nick Fury,"I don't know. Something dramatic, I hope."
609,Clint Barton,I'm gonna finish re-flooring that sunroom as soon as I get back.
610,Laura Barton,"Yeah, and then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart."
611,Clint Barton,No. It's the last project. I promise.
612,Erik Selvig,This is it. The Water of Sight.
613,Thor,"In every realm, there's a reflection. If the water spirits accept me, I can return to my dream, and find what I missed."
614,Erik Selvig,"The men who enter that water, the legends don't end well."
615,Tony Stark,"A hacker who's faster than Ultron? He could be anywhere. And as this is the center of everything, I'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack."
616,World Hub Tech,How do you find it?
617,Tony Stark,Pretty simple. You bring a magnet.
618,Heimdall,Wake up!
619,Erik Selvig,Thor!
620,Ultron,
621,Dr. Helen Cho,"Cellular cohesion will take a few hours, but we can initiate the consciousness stream. We're uploading your cerebral matrix...now."
622,Wanda Maximoff,I can read him. He is dreaming.
623,Dr. Helen Cho,"I wouldn't call it dreams. It's Ultron's base consciousness, informational noise. Soon..."
624,Ultron,How soon? I'm not being pushy.
625,Dr. Helen Cho,We're imprinting a physical brain. There are no shortcuts. Even if your magic gem is...
626,Wanda Maximoff,How could you?
627,Ultron,How could I what?
628,Wanda Maximoff,"You said we would destroy the Avengers, make a better world."
629,Ultron,It will be better.
630,Wanda Maximoff,When everyone is dead.
631,Ultron,That is not...! The human race will have every opportunity to improve.
632,Pietro Maximoff,And if they don't?
633,Ultron,Ask Noah.
634,Wanda Maximoff,You're a madman.
635,Ultron,"There were more than a dozen extinction level events before even the dinosaurs got theirs. When the Earth starts to settle, God throws a stone at it, and believe me, he's winding up. We have to evolve. There's no room for the weak."
636,Pietro Maximoff,And who decides who's weak?
637,Ultron,Life. Life always decides. There's incoming. The Quinjet. We have to move.
638,Dr. Helen Cho,That's not a problem.
639,Ultron,"Ah, wait, guys!."
640,Steve Rogers,Dr. Cho!
641,Dr. Helen Cho,He's uploading himself into the body.
642,Steve Rogers,Where?
643,Dr. Helen Cho,"The real power is inside the Cradle. The gem, its power is uncontainable. You can't just blow it up. You have to get the Cradle to Stark."
644,Steve Rogers,First I have to find it.
645,Dr. Helen Cho,Go.
646,Steve Rogers,Did you guys copy that?
647,Clint Barton,We did.
648,Natasha Romanoff,"I got a private jet taking off, across town, no manifest. That could be him."
649,Clint Barton,"There. It's the truck from the lab. Right above you, Cap. On the loop by the bridge. It's them. I got three with the Cradle, one in the cab. I could take out the driver."
650,Steve Rogers,"Negative! If that truck crashes, the gem could level the city. We need to draw out Ultron."
651,Ultron,"No, no, no, no, no. Leave me alone!"
652,Steve Rogers,"Well, he's definitely unhappy! I'm gonna try and keep him that way."
653,Clint Barton,"You're not a match for him, Cap."
654,Steve Rogers,"Thanks, Barton."
655,Ultron,"You know what's in that Cradle? The power to make real change, and that terrifies you."
656,Steve Rogers,I wouldn't call it a comfort.
657,Ultron,Stop it!
658,Clint Barton,
659,Natasha Romanoff,I'm always picking up after you boys.
660,Clint Barton,"They're heading under the overpass, I've got no shot."
661,Natasha Romanoff,Which way?
662,Clint Barton,Hard right... Now.
663,Natasha Romanoff,
664,Steve Rogers,Come on!
665,Natasha Romanoff,"Clint, can you draw out the guards?"
666,Clint Barton,Let's find out.
667,Natasha Romanoff,
668,Clint Barton,"Heading back towards you. So whatever you're going to do, do it now."
669,Natasha Romanoff,"I'm going in, Cap can you keep him occupied?"
670,Steve Rogers,
671,Clint Barton,The package is airborne. I have a clean shot.
672,Natasha Romanoff,Negative. I am still in the truck.
673,Clint Barton,What the hell are you...?
674,Natasha Romanoff,"Just be ready, I'm sending the package to you."
675,Clint Barton,How do you want me to take it?
676,Natasha Romanoff,"Uhh, you might wish you hadn't asked that."
677,Ultron,Please. Don't do this.
678,Wanda Maximoff,What choice do we have?
679,Steve Rogers,I lost him! He's headed your way.
680,Clint Barton,"Nat, we gotta go."
681,Clint Barton,"Nat! Cap, you see Nat?"
682,Steve Rogers,"If you have the package, get it to Stark! Go!"
683,Clint Barton,Do you have eyes on Nat?
684,Steve Rogers,Go!
685,Pietro Maximoff,I'm fine. I just need to take a minute.
686,Steve Rogers,I'm very tempted not to give you one.
687,Wanda Maximoff,"The Cradle, did you get it?"
688,Steve Rogers,Stark will take care of it.
689,Wanda Maximoff,"No, he won't."
690,Steve Rogers,"You don't know what you're talking about, Stark's not crazy."
691,Wanda Maximoff,He will do anything to make things right.
692,Steve Rogers,"Stark, come in. Stark. Anyone on comms?"
693,Wanda Maximoff,Ultron can't tell the difference between saving the world and destroying it. Where do you think he gets that?
694,Bruce Banner,Anything on Nat?
695,Tony Stark,"Haven't heard. But she's alive, or Ultron'd be rubbing our faces in it."
696,Clint Barton,This is sealed tight.
697,Bruce Banner,"We're going to need to access the program, break it down from within."
698,Tony Stark,"Hm. Any chance Natasha might leave you a message, outside the internet, old school spy stuff?"
699,Clint Barton,"There's some nets I can cast. Yeah, alright. I'll find her."
700,Bruce Banner,"I can work on tissue degeneration, if you can fry whatever operational system Cho implanted."
701,Tony Stark,"Yeah, about that."
702,Bruce Banner,No.
703,Tony Stark,You have to trust me.
704,Bruce Banner,Kinda don't.
705,Tony Stark,Our ally? The guy protecting the military's nuclear codes? I found him.
706,JARVIS,"Hello, Dr. Banner."
707,Tony Stark,"Ultron didn't go after JARVIS cause he was angry. He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do. So JARVIS went underground. Okay? Scattered, dumped his memory. But not his protocols. He didn't even know he was in there, until I pieced him together."
708,Bruce Banner,"So, you want me to help you put JARVIS into this thing?"
709,Tony Stark,"No, of course not! I want to help you put JARVIS in this thing.  We're out of my field here. You know bio-organics better than anyone."
710,Bruce Banner,And you just assume that JARVIS' operational matrix can beat Ultron's?
711,Tony Stark,"JARVIS has been beating him from inside without knowing it. This is the opportunity, we can create Ultron's perfect self, without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality. We have to."
712,JARVIS,I believe it's worth a go.
713,Bruce Banner,"No, I'm in a loop! I'm caught in a time loop, this is exactly where it all went wrong."
714,Tony Stark,"I know, I know. I know what everyone's going to say, but they're already saying it. We're mad scientists. We're monsters, buddy. You gotta own it. Make a stand.  It's not a loop. It's the end of the line."
715,Ultron,
716,Tony Stark,This framework is not compatible.
717,Bruce Banner,The genetic coding tower's at ninety-seven percent. You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes.
718,Steve Rogers,I'm gonna say this once.
719,Tony Stark,"How about ""nonce""?"
720,Steve Rogers,Shut it down!
721,Tony Stark,"Nope, not gonna happen."
722,Steve Rogers,You don't know what you're doing.
723,Bruce Banner,And you do? She's not in your head?
724,Wanda Maximoff,I know you're angry.
725,Bruce Banner,"Oh, we're way past that. I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade."
726,Steve Rogers,"Banner, after everything that's happened..."
727,Tony Stark,That's nothing compared to what's coming!
728,Wanda Maximoff,You don't know what's in there!
729,Steve Rogers,This isn't a game...
730,Wanda Maximoff,The creature...!
731,Pietro Maximoff,"No, no. Go on. You were saying?"
732,Wanda Maximoff,Pietro!
733,Clint Barton,What? You didn't see that coming?
734,Bruce Banner,
735,Vision,"I'm sorry, that was...odd.  Thank you."
736,Steve Rogers,"Thor, you helped create this?"
737,Thor,I've had a vision. A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life and at it's center is that.
738,Bruce Banner,"What, the gem?"
739,Thor,"It's the Mind Stone. It's one of the six Infinity Stones, the greatest power in the universe, unparalleled in its destructive capabilities."
740,Steve Rogers,Then why would you bring it to...
741,Thor,Because Stark is right.
742,Bruce Banner,"Oh, it's definitely the end times."
743,Thor,The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.
744,Vision,Not alone.
745,Steve Rogers,"Why does your ""vision"" sound like JARVIS?"
746,Tony Stark,We...we reconfigured JARVIS' matrix to create something new.
747,Steve Rogers,I think I've had my fill of new.
748,Vision,You think I'm a child of Ultron?
749,Steve Rogers,You're not?
750,Vision,I'm not Ultron. I'm not JARVIS. I am...I am.
751,Wanda Maximoff,I looked in your head and saw annihilation.
752,Vision,Look again.
753,Clint Barton,Yeah. Her seal of approval means jack to me.
754,Thor,"Their powers, the horrors in our heads, Ultron himself, they all came from the Mind Stone, and they're nothing compared to what it can unleash. But with it on our side..."
755,Steve Rogers,Is it? Are you? On our side?
756,Vision,I don't think it's that simple.
757,Clint Barton,Well it better get real simple real soon.
758,Vision,"I am on the side of life. Ultron isn't, he will end it all."
759,Tony Stark,What's he waiting for?
760,Vision,You.
761,Bruce Banner,Where?
762,Clint Barton,Sokovia. He's got Nat there too.
763,Bruce Banner,"If we're wrong about you, if you're the monster that Ultron made you to be..."
764,Vision,What will you do?
765,Thor,Right.  Well done.
766,Steve Rogers,
767,FRIDAY,"Good evening, boss."
768,Tony Stark,"No way we all get through this. If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost. It's gonna be blood on the floor."
769,Steve Rogers,I got no plans tomorrow night.
770,Tony Stark,I get first crack at the big guy. Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.
771,Vision,"That's true, he hates you the most."
772,Steve Rogers,"Ultron knows we're coming. Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire, and that's what we signed up for. But the people of Sokovia, they didn't. So our priority is getting them out."
773,Pietro Maximoff,"We're under attack! Clear the city, now!"
774,Steve Rogers,"All they want is to live their lives in peace, and that's not going to happen today. But we can do our best to protect them. And we can get the job done, and find out what Ultron's been building. We find Romanoff, and we clear the field. Keep the fight between us. Ultron thinks we're monsters and we're what's wrong with the world. This isn't just about beating him. It's about whether he's right."
775,Bruce Banner,Natasha! Natasha!
776,Natasha Romanoff,Bruce?
777,Bruce Banner,You alright?
778,Natasha Romanoff,Yeah.
779,Bruce Banner,"The team's in the city, it's about to light up."
780,Natasha Romanoff,I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere?
781,Bruce Banner,"Yeah, I did."
782,Natasha Romanoff,So what's our play?
783,Bruce Banner,I'm here to get you to safety.
784,Natasha Romanoff,Job's not finished.
785,Bruce Banner,"We could help with the evacuation, but I can't be in a fight near civilians. And you've done plenty. Our fight is over."
786,Natasha Romanoff,So we just disappear?
787,FRIDAY,"Your man's in the church, boss. I think he's waiting for you."
788,Ultron,Come to confess your sins?
789,Tony Stark,"I don't know, how much time you got?"
790,Ultron,More than you.
791,Tony Stark,"Uhhh. Have you been juicing? A little Vibranium cocktail? You're looking, I don't wanna say, puffy..."
792,Ultron,You're stalling to protect the people.
793,Tony Stark,"Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?"
794,Ultron,"I've moved beyond your mission. I'm free.  What, you think you're the only one stalling?"
795,FRIDAY,There's the rest of the Vibranium. Function: still unclear.
796,Ultron,"This is how you end, Tony. This is peace in my time."
797,Steve Rogers,Go!
798,Wanda Maximoff,Get off the bridge! Run!
799,Vision,Ultron.
800,Ultron,My Vision. They really did take everything from me.
801,Vision,"You set the terms, you can change them."
802,Ultron,Alright.
803,Tony Stark,FRIDAY! The Vision?
804,FRIDAY,"Boss, it's working. He's burning Ultron out of the net, he won't escape through there."
805,Ultron,
806,Tony Stark,FRIDAY?
807,FRIDAY,Sokovia's going for a ride.
808,Ultron,"Do you see? The beauty of it, the inevitability. You rise, only to fall. You, Avengers, you are my meteor, my swift and terrible sword and the earth will crack with the weight of your failure. Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me. It means nothing. When the dust settles, the only thing living in this world will be metal."
809,Bruce Banner,We gotta move.
810,Natasha Romanoff,You're not going to turn green?
811,Bruce Banner,I've got a compelling reason not to lose my cool.
812,Natasha Romanoff,I adore you.
813,FRIDAY,"The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field, that's what's keeping the rock together."
814,Tony Stark,If it drops?
815,FRIDAY,Right now the impact would kill thousands. Once it gets high enough: Global extinction.
816,Tony Stark,Hi. Okay. Get in the tub!
817,FRIDAY,"I got airborne, heading up to the bridge."
818,Tony Stark,"Cap, you got incoming."
819,Steve Rogers,"Incoming already came in. Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely. The rest of us have one job: tear these things apart. You get hurt, hurt 'em back. You get killed, walk it off."
820,Clint Barton,"Go, go, move!"
821,Wanda Maximoff,How could I let this happen?
822,Clint Barton,"Hey, hey, you okay?"
823,Wanda Maximoff,This is all our fault.
824,Clint Barton,"Hey, look at me. It's your fault, it's everyone's fault, who cares. Are you up for this? Are you? Look, I just need to know, cause the city is flying. Okay, look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow. None of this makes sense. But I'm going back out there because it's my job. Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit. It doesn't matter what you did, or what you were. If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill. Stay in here, you're good, I'll send your brother to come find you, but if you step out that door, you are an Avenger."
825,Steve Rogers,
826,Ultron,You can't save them all. You'll never...
827,Steve Rogers,"You'll never what? You didn't finish!  What, were you napping?"
828,Ultron,
829,Clint Barton,"Alright, we're all clear here."
830,Steve Rogers,We are not clear! We are very not clear!
831,Clint Barton,"Alright, coming to you."
832,Pietro Maximoff,Keep up old man!
833,Clint Barton,"Nobody would know. Nobody. ""The last I saw him, when Ultron was sitting on him. Uh...yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard. I miss him already."""
834,Steve Rogers,
835,Natasha Romanoff,Thanks.
836,FRIDAY,"The anti-gravs are rigged to flip. Touch 'em, they'll go full reverse thrust. The city's not coming down slow."
837,Tony Stark,The spire's Vibranium. If I get Thor to hit it...
838,FRIDAY,"It'll crack, but that's not enough, the impact would still be devastating."
839,Tony Stark,"Maybe if we cap the other end, keep the atomic action doubling back."
840,FRIDAY,"That could vaporize the city, and everyone on it."
841,Steve Rogers,"The next wave's gonna hit any minute. What have you got, Stark?"
842,Tony Stark,"Well, nothing great. Maybe a way to blow up the city. That'll keep it from impacting the surface if you guys can get clear."
843,Steve Rogers,"I asked for a solution, not an escape plan."
844,Tony Stark,Impact radius is getting bigger every second. We're going to have to make a choice.
845,Natasha Romanoff,"Cap, these people are going nowhere. If Stark finds a way to blow this rock..."
846,Steve Rogers,Not 'til everyone's safe.
847,Natasha Romanoff,Everyone up here versus everyone down there? There's no math there.
848,Steve Rogers,I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.
849,Natasha Romanoff,I didn't say we should leave.  There's worse ways to go. Where else am I gonna get a view like this?
850,Nick Fury,"Nice, right? I pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends. She's dusty, but she'll do."
851,Steve Rogers,"Fury, you son of a bitch."
852,Nick Fury,Oooh! You kiss your mother with that mouth?
853,Maria Hill,Altitude is eighteen thousand and climbing.
854,Specialist Cameron Klein,"Lifeboats secure to deploy. Disengage in three, two...take 'em out."
855,Pietro Maximoff,This is SHIELD?
856,Steve Rogers,This is what SHIELD's supposed to be.
857,Pietro Maximoff,This is not so bad.
858,Steve Rogers,Let's load 'em up.
859,Maria Hill,"Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank."
860,Nick Fury,Show 'em what we got.
861,Maria Hill,You're up.
862,James Rhodes,Yes! Now this is gonna be a good story.
863,Tony Stark,Yep. If you live to tell it.
864,James Rhodes,You think I can't hold my own?
865,Tony Stark,"We get through this, I'll hold your own."
866,James Rhodes,You had to make it weird.
867,Clint Barton,"Alright, let's load 'em up! Alright, here we go. Here we go, let's move. Let's go everyone!"
868,Specialist Cameron Klein,"Number six boat is topped and locked. Or, uh, or stocked, topped. It...it's, uh, full of people."
869,Maria Hill,Incoming!
870,Specialist Cameron Klein,"Oh, God!"
871,Ultron,You think you're saving anyone? I turn that key and drop this rock a little early and it's still billions dead. Even you can't stop that.
872,Thor,"I am Thor, son of Odin, and as long as there is life in my breast, I am...running out of things to say! Are you ready?"
873,Vision,It's terribly well balanced.
874,Thor,"Well, if there's too much weight, you lose power on the swing, so."
875,Tony Stark,I got it! Create a heat seal. I can...I can supercharge the spire from below.
876,FRIDAY,Running numbers.  A heat seal could work with enough power.
877,Tony Stark,"Thor, I got a plan!"
878,Thor,We're out of time. They're coming for the core.
879,Tony Stark,"Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier."
880,James Rhodes,On it.
881,Tony Stark,"Avengers, time to work for a living."
882,Pietro Maximoff,You good?
883,Wanda Maximoff,Yeah.
884,Tony Stark,"Romanoff? You and Banner better not be playing ""hide the zucchini."""
885,Natasha Romanoff,"Relax, Shell-head. Not all of us can fly.  What's the drill?"
886,Tony Stark,
887,Thor,Is that the best you can do?
888,Steve Rogers,You had to ask.
889,Ultron,"This is the best I can do. This is exactly what I wanted. All of you, against all of me. How could you possibly hope to stop me?"
890,Tony Stark,"Well, like the old man said. Together."
891,Ultron,"You know, with the benefit of hindsight...."
892,Thor,They'll try to leave the city.
893,Tony Stark,"We can't let 'em, not even one. Rhodey!"
894,James Rhodes,"I'm on it.  Okay, what?"
895,Steve Rogers,"We gotta move out. Even I can tell the air is getting thin. You guys get to the boats, I'll sweep for stragglers, be right behind you."
896,Clint Barton,What about the core?
897,Wanda Maximoff,I'll protect it. It's my job.
898,Wanda Maximoff,Get the people on the boats.
899,Pietro Maximoff,I'm not going to leave you here.
900,Wanda Maximoff,"I can handle this.  Come back for me when everyone else is off, not before."
901,Pietro Maximoff,Hmm.
902,Wanda Maximoff,You understand?
903,Pietro Maximoff,"You know, I'm twelve minutes older than you."
904,Wanda Maximoff,Go.
905,FRIDAY,"Boss, power levels are way below opt..."
906,Tony Stark,Re-route everything. We get one shot at this.
907,Clint Barton,"I know what I need to do. The dining room! If I knock out that east wall, it'll make a nice work space for Laura, huh? Put up some baffling, she can't hear the kids running around, what do you think?"
908,Natasha Romanoff,You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.
909,Clint Barton,No one eats in a dining room.  We don't have a lot of time.
910,Natasha Romanoff,So get your ass on a boat.
911,Zrinka,Costel? We were in the market. Costel?!
912,Tony Stark,"Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church."
913,Thor,Is this the last of them?
914,Steve Rogers,Yeah. Everyone else is on the carrier.
915,Tony Stark,"You know, if this works, we maybe don't walk away."
916,Thor,Maybe not.
917,Ultron,
918,Pietro Maximoff,You didn't see that coming.
919,Ultron,"Oh, for God's sake!"
920,Clint Barton,"No, no. I'm fine."
921,Ultron,"Wanda, if you stay here, you'll die."
922,Wanda Maximoff,I just did. Do you know how it felt?
923,Tony Stark,"Thor, on my mark."
924,Natasha Romanoff,
925,Vision,You're afraid.
926,Ultron,Of you?
927,Vision,Of death. You're the last one.
928,Ultron,"You were supposed to be the last. Stark asked for a savior, and settled for a slave."
929,Vision,I suppose we're both disappointments.
930,Ultron,I suppose we are.
931,Vision,"Humans are odd. They think order and chaos are somehow opposites, and try to control what won't be. But there is grace in their failings. I think you missed that."
932,Ultron,They're doomed.
933,Vision,Yes. But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts. It's a privilege to be among them.
934,Ultron,You're unbearably naive.
935,Vision,"Well, I was born yesterday."
936,Laura Barton,
937,Natasha Romanoff,Fat.
938,Nick Fury,"One of our tech boys flagged this, splashed down in the Banda Sea. Could be the Quinjet. But with Stark's stealth tech, we still can't track the damn thing."
939,Natasha Romanoff,Right.
940,Nick Fury,Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji. He'll send a postcard.
941,Natasha Romanoff,"""Wish you were here."" You sent me to recruit him, way back when. Did you know then what was going to happen?"
942,Nick Fury,You never know. You hope for the best and make do with what you get. I got a great team.
943,Natasha Romanoff,Nothing lasts forever.
944,Nick Fury,"Trouble, Miss Romanoff. No matter who wins or loses, trouble still comes around."
945,Steve Rogers,The rules have changed.
946,Tony Stark,We're dealing with something new.
947,Steve Rogers,"Well, the Vision's artificial intelligence."
948,Tony Stark,A machine.
949,Steve Rogers,So it doesn't count.
950,Tony Stark,No. It's not like a person lifting the hammer.
951,Steve Rogers,Right. Different rules for us.
952,Tony Stark,"Nice guy, but artificial."
953,Steve Rogers,Thank you.
954,Thor,"If he can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone. It's safe with the Vision and these days, safe is in short supply."
955,Steve Rogers,But if you put the hammer in an elevator...
956,Tony Stark,It would still go up.
957,Steve Rogers,Elevator's not worthy.
958,Thor,I'm going to miss these little talks of ours.
959,Tony Stark,"Well, not if you don't leave."
960,Thor,I have no choice. The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones to show up in the last few years. That's not a coincidence. Someone has been playing an intricate game and has made pawns of us. But once all these pieces are in position...
961,Tony Stark,Triple Yahtzee?
962,Steve Rogers,You think you can find out what's coming?
963,Thor,"I do. Besides this one, there's nothing that can't be explained."
964,Tony Stark,That man has no regard for lawn maintenance. I'm gonna miss him though. And you're gonna miss me. There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.
965,Steve Rogers,"I will miss you, Tony."
966,Tony Stark,"Yeah? Well, it's time for me to tap out. Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book and build Pepper a farm, hope nobody blows it up."
967,Steve Rogers,The simple life.
968,Tony Stark,You'll get there one day.
969,Steve Rogers,"I don't know, family, stability. The guy who wanted all that went in the ice seventy-five years ago. I think someone else came out."
970,Tony Stark,You alright?
971,Steve Rogers,"I'm home.  You want to keep staring at the wall, or do you want to go to work? I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall."
972,Natasha Romanoff,I thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other's eyes. How do we look?
973,Steve Rogers,"Well, we're not the '27 Yankees."
974,Natasha Romanoff,We've got some hitters.
975,Steve Rogers,They're good. They're not a team.
976,Natasha Romanoff,Let's beat 'em into shape.
977,Steve Rogers,Avengers...!
0,CLINT BARTON,"Okay, hold on. Don't shoot. You see where you're going?"
1,LILA BARTON,Mhm.
2,CLINT BARTON,"Okay, now let's worry about how you get there."
3,CLINT BARTON,Here. Can you see?
4,LILA BARTON,Yeah.
5,CLINT BARTON,You sure?
6,LILA BARTON,Mhm.
7,CLINT BARTON,How about now?
8,CLINT BARTON,Alright. Ready your fingers.
9,COOPER BARTON,Nice.
10,LAURA BARTON,"Nice throw, kiddo."
11,COOPER BARTON,You go.
12,LAURA BARTON,"Hey, you guys want mayo or mustard, or both?"
13,LILA BARTON,Who wants mayo on a hotdog?
14,CLINT BARTON,Probably your brothers.
15,CLINT BARTON,"Uh, two mustard, please! Thanks, mama."
16,LAURA BARTON,Mayo or mustard?
17,NATHANIEL BARTON,How about ketchup?
18,LAURA BARTON,Ketchup?  I can do ketchup.
19,CLINT BARTON,"Mind your elbow.  Hahaha! Good job, Hawkeye. Go get your arrow."
20,LAURA BARTON,"Hey guys! Enough practice, soup's on!"
21,CLINT BARTON,"Alright, we're coming; we're hungry.  Hey, babe! Babe? Babe? Boys? Boys? Laura?"
22,NEBULA,Wrra!
23,TONY STARK,You don't need to do that. Because uh... you're just holding position.  That's a goal. We're now one apiece.
24,NEBULA,I would like to try again.
25,TONY STARK,We're tied up. Feel the tension? It's fun.
26,TONY STARK,That was terrible. Now you have a chance to win.
27,TONY STARK,And... you've won. Congratulations.
28,TONY STARK,Fair game. Good sport.  Have fun?
29,NEBULA,It was fun.
30,TONY STARK,"This thing on?  But it's now dead in the water. We're 1000 light years from the nearest 7-11. Oxygen will run out tomorrow. And that'll be it. And Pep, I ... I know I said no more surprises, but I was really hoping to pull off one last one. But it looks like... well you know what it looks like. Don't feel bad about this. I mean, if you grovel for a couple of weeks, and then move on with enormous guilt. I should probably lie down. Please know that... when I drift off, I will think about you. Because it's always you."
31,TONY STARK,Couldn't stop him.
32,STEVE ROGERS,Neither could I.
33,TONY STARK,I lost the kid.
34,STEVE ROGERS,"Tony, we lost."
35,TONY STARK,"Is, uh...?"
36,PEPPER POTTS,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
37,TONY STARK,It's okay.
38,JAMES RHODES,It's been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth.
39,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"World governments are in pieces. The parts that are still working are trying to take a census. And it looks like he did... he did exactly what he said he was gonna do. Thanos wiped out fifty percent, of all living creatures."
40,TONY STARK,Where is he now? Where?
41,STEVE ROGERS,We don't know. He just opened a portal and walked through.
42,TONY STARK,What's wrong with him?
43,ROCKET,"Oh, he's pissed. He thinks he failed. Which of course he did, but you know there's a lot of that's going around, ain't there?"
44,TONY STARK,"Honestly, until this exact second, I thought you were a Build-A-Bear."
45,ROCKET,Maybe I am.
46,STEVE ROGERS,"We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now. Deep Space scans, and satellites, and we got nothing. Tony, you fought him."
47,TONY STARK,"Who told you that?  I didn't fight him. No, he wiped my face with a planet while the Bleecker Street Magician gave away the store. That's what happened. There was no fight."
48,STEVE ROGERS,Okay.
49,TONY STARK,He's unbeatable.
50,STEVE ROGERS,"Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything?"
51,TONY STARK,Pfft! I saw this coming a few years back. I had a vision. I didn't wanna believe it. Thought I was dreaming.
52,STEVE ROGERS,"Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus."
53,TONY STARK,I need to shave. And I believe I remember telling all youse -
54,RHODEY,"Tony, Tony, Tony!"
55,TONY STARK,Alive and otherwise what we needed was a suit of armor around the world! Remember that? Whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not- that's what we needed!
56,STEVE ROGERS,"Well, that didn't work out, did it?"
57,TONY STARK,"I said, ""we'd lose"". You said, ""We'll do that together too."" And guess what, Cap? We lost. And you weren't there. But that's what we do, right? Our best work after the fact? We're the Avengers, we're the Avengers. Not the Prevengers."
58,RHODEY,Okay.
59,TONY STARK,Right?
60,RHODEY,You made your point. Just sit down.
61,TONY STARK,Okay...
62,RHODEY,Okay?
63,TONY STARK,"Nah, nah. Here's my point. You know what?"
64,RHODEY,"Tony, you're sick."
65,TONY STARK,"She's great, by the way."
66,RHODEY,Sit down. Sit.
67,TONY STARK,"We need you. You're new blood. Bunch of tired old mules!  I got nothing for you, Cap! I got no coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options. Zero. Zip. Nada. No trust. Liar."
68,TONY STARK,"Here, take this. You find him, and you put that on. You hide."
69,STEVE ROGERS,Tony!
70,TONY STARK,I'm fine. I...
71,RHODEY,Bruce gave him a sedative. He's gonna probably be out for the rest of the day.
72,CAROL DANVERS,You guys take care of him. And I'll bring him a Xorrian Elixir when I come back.
73,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Where are you going?
74,CAROL DANVERS,To kill Thanos.
75,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Hey, you know, we usually work as a team here, and between you and I, morale's a little fragile."
76,STEVE ROGERS,"We realize up there is more your territory, but this is our fight too."
77,RHODEY,You even know where he is?
78,CAROL DANVERS,I know people who might.
79,NEBULA,"Don't bother. I can tell you where Thanos is. Thanos spent a long time trying to perfect me. And when he worked, he talked about his great plan. Even disassembled, I wanted to please him. I'd ask ""where would we go once his plan was complete?"". His answer was always the same: ""To the Garden."""
80,RHODEY,"That's cute, Thanos has a retirement plan."
81,STEVE ROGERS,So where is he?
82,ROCKET,"When Thanos snapped his fingers, Earth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions. No one's ever seen anything like it... Until two days ago.  On this planet."
83,NEBULA,Thanos is there.
84,NATASHA ROMANOFF,He used the stones again.
85,BRUCE BANNER,"Hey, hey, hey. We'd be going in short-handed, you know."
86,RHODEY,"Look, he's still got the stones, so..."
87,CAROL DANVERS,So let's get him... Use them to bring everyone back.
88,RHODEY,Just like that?
89,STEVE ROGERS,"Yeah, just like that."
90,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Even if there's a small chance that we can undo this... I mean we owe it to everyone who's not in this room to try.
91,BRUCE BANNER,"If we do this, how do we know it's gonna end any differently than it did before?"
92,CAROL DANVERS,"Because before, you didn't have me."
93,RHODEY,"Hey, new girl, everyone here is about that superhero life. And if you don't mind my asking, where the hell have you been all this time?"
94,CAROL DANVERS,"There are a lot of other planets in the universe. And unfortunately, they didn't have you guys."
95,THOR,I like this one.
96,STEVE ROGERS,Let's go get this son of a bitch.
97,[Title Screen,Avengers: Endgame]
98,ROCKET,"Okay, who here hasn't been to space?"
99,RHODEY,Why?
100,ROCKET,You better not throw up on my ship.
101,NEBULA,Approaching jump in 3... 2... 1!
102,CAROL DANVERS,I'll head down for recon.
103,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"This is gonna work, Steve."
104,STEVE ROGERS,I know it will.
105,STEVE ROGERS,Cause I don't know what I'm going to do if it doesn't.
106,CAROL DANVERS,"No satellites, no ships, no armies, no ground defenses of any kind. It's just him."
107,NEBULA,And that's enough.
108,ROCKET,Oh no.
109,STEVE ROGERS,Where are they?
110,CAROL DANVERS,Answer the question!
111,THANOS,"The universe required correction. After that, the stones served no purpose, beyond temptation."
112,BRUCE BANNER,You murdered trillions!
113,THANOS,You should be grateful.
114,NATASHA ROMANONFF,Where are the Stones?
115,THANOS,Gone. Reduced to atoms.
116,BRUCE BANNER,You used them two days ago!
117,THANOS,I used the stones to destroy the stones. It nearly killed me. But the work is done. It always will be.  I am... inevitable.
118,RHODEY,"We have to tear this place apart, he-he-he has to be lying."
119,NEBULA,My father is many things. A liar is not one of them.
120,THANOS,"Ah, thank you, daughter.  Perhaps I treated you too harshly."
121,ROCKET,What... What did you do?
122,THOR,I went for the head.
123,JOE RUSSO,"So I, uh... Went on a date the other day. It's the first time in five years, you know? I'm sitting there at dinner... I didn't even know what to talk about."
124,STEVE ROGERS,What did you talk about?
125,JOE RUSSO,"Same old crap, you know? How things have changed, and... my job, his job... How much we miss the Mets. And then things get quiet... He cried as they were serving the salads."
126,JIM STARLIN,What about you?
127,JOE RUSSO,"I cried... just before dessert. But I'm seeing him again tomorrow, so..."
128,STEVE ROGERS,"That's great. You did the hardest part. You took the jump, you didn't know where you were gonna come down. And that's it. That's those little brave baby steps we gotta take. To try and become whole again, try and find purpose. I went in the ice in '45 right after I met the love of my life. Woke up 70 years later. You gotta move on. Gotta to move on. The world is in our hands. It's left to us guys, and we got to do something with it. Otherwise... Thanos should have killed all of us."

132,SCOTT LANG,Kid! Hey kid!
133,SCOTT LANG,What the hell happened here?
134,SCOTT LANG,"No. Please. Please, please.  Excuse me, sorry. No, Cassie, no."

136,SCOTT LANG,What?
137,SCOTT LANG,Cassie?
138,CASSIE LANG,Dad?
139,SCOTT LANG,You're so big!
140,ROCKET,"Yeah, we boarded that highly suspect warship Danvers pinged."
141,"[The camera cuts showing a few of the Avengers in holographic calls from the left to right, respectively","Nebula and Rocket Raccoon, Okoye, Danvers with a tomboyish haircut, and Rhodes.]"
142,NEBULA,It was an infectious garbage scowl.
143,ROCKET,"So, thanks for the hot tip."
144,CAROL DANVERS,"Well, you were closer."
145,ROCKET,Yeah. And now we smell like garbage.
146,NATASHA ROMANOFF,You get a reading on those tremors?
147,OKOYE,It was a mild subduction under the African plate.
148,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Do we have a visual? How are we handling it?
149,OKOYE,"Nat, it's an earthquake under the ocean. We handle it by not handling it."
150,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Carol, are we seeing you here next month?"
151,CAROL DANVERS,Not likely.
152,ROCKET,"What, you gonna get another haircut?"
153,CAROL DANVERS,"Listen fur-face, I'm covering a lot of territory. The things that are happening on Earth, are happening everywhere, on thousands of planets."
154,ROCKET,"All right, all right, that's a good point. That's a good point."
155,CAROL DANVERS,So you might not see me for a long time.
156,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Alright. Uh, well. This channel is always active. So, if anything goes sideways... anyone's making trouble where they shouldn't... comes through me."
157,ROCKET,Okay.
158,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Alright.
159,CAROL DANVERS,
160,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Where are you?
161,RHODEY,Mexico. The Federales found a room full of bodies. Looks like a bunch of cartel guys. Never even had the chance to get their guns off.
162,NATASHA ROMANOFF,It's probably a rival gang.
163,RHODEY,"Except it isn't.  I gotta tell you, there's a part of me that doesn't even want to find him."
164,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Will you find out where he's going next?
165,RHODEY,Nat...
166,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Please.
167,RHODEY,
168,STEVE ROGERS,You know I'd offer to cook you dinner but you seem pretty miserable already.
169,NATASHA ROMANOFF,You here to do your laundry?
170,STEVE ROGERS,And to see a friend.
171,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Clearly, your friend is fine."
172,STEVE ROGERS,You know I saw a pod of whales when I was coming up the bridge.
173,NATASHA ROMANOFF,In the Hudson?
174,STEVE ROGERS,"There's fewer ships, cleaner water."
175,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"You know, if you're about to tell me to look on the bright side. Um... I'm about you to hit you in the head with a peanut butter sandwich."
176,STEVE ROGERS,Sorry. Force of habit.
177,STEVE ROGERS,"You know, I keep telling everybody they should move on and... grow. Some do. But not us."
178,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"If I move on, who does this?"
179,STEVE ROGERS,Maybe it doesn't need to be done.
180,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I used to have nothing. And then I got this. This job... this family. And I was... I was better because of it. And even though... they're gone... I'm still trying to be better.
181,STEVE ROGERS,I think we both need to get a life.
182,NATASHA ROMANOFF,You first.
183,SCOTT LANG,"Oh! Hi. Hi! Is anyone home? This is Scott Lang. We met a few years ago, at the airport? In Germany? I got really big, and I had my mask on. You wouldn't recognize me."
184,STEVE ROGERS,Is this an old message?
185,NATASHA ROMANOFF,It's the front gate.
186,SCOTT LANG,"Ant-Man? Ant-Man, I know you know that. I need to talk to you guys."
187,STEVE ROGERS,Scott. Are you okay?
188,SCOTT LANG,Yeah. I'm fine.
189,SCOTT LANG,Have you ever studied Quantum Physics?
190,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Only to make conversation.
191,SCOTT LANG,"Alright. So... five years ago, right before Thanos, I was in a place called the Quantum Realm. The Quantum Realm is like its own microscopic universe. To get in there, you have to be incredibly small. Hope, she's my... She was my...  She was supposed to pull me out. And then Thanos happened, and I got stuck in there."
192,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I'm sorry. That must've been a very long five years.
193,SCOTT LANG,"Yeah, but that's just it. It wasn't. For me, it was five hours."
194,SCOTT LANG,"See, the rules of the Quantum Realm aren't like they are up here. Everything is unpredictable. Is that anybody's sandwich? I'm starving."
195,STEVE ROGERS,"Scott, what are you talking about?"
196,SCOTT LANG,"What I'm saying is, time works differently in the Quantum Realm. The only problem is right now, we don't have a way to navigate it. But what if we did? I can't stop thinking about it. What if, we could somehow control the chaos, and we could navigate it? What if there was a way to enter the Quantum Realm at a certain point in time but then exit at another point in time? Like... Like before Thanos."
197,STEVE ROGERS,"Wait, are you talking about a time machine?"
198,SCOTT LANG,"No. No, of course not. No, not a time machine. It's more like a... Yeah, a time machine. I know it's crazy. But I can't stop thinking about it. There's gotta be some way... There's gotta be...some w... it's crazy."
199,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Scott, I get e-mails from a raccoon, so nothing sounds crazy anymore."
200,SCOTT LANG,So who do we talk to about this?
201,TONY STARK,Maguna? Morgan H. Stark. You want some lunch?
202,MORGAN STARK,Define lunch or be disintegrated.
203,TONY STARK,"Okay, You should not be wearing that, okay? That is part of a special anniversary gift I'm making for Mom."
204,MORGAN STARK,Okay.
205,TONY STARK,There you go. Are you thinking about lunch? I can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce.
206,MORGAN STARK,No.
207,TONY STARK,That's what you want. How did you find this?
208,MORGAN STARK,Garage.
209,TONY STARK,Really? Were you looking for it?
210,MORGAN STARK,"No. I found it, though."
211,TONY STARK,"You like going to the garage, huh? So does daddy. It's fine, actually. Your mom never wears anything I buy her."
212,SCOTT LANG,"Now, we know what it sounds like..."
213,STEVE ROGERS,"Tony, after everything you've seen, is anything really impossible?"
214,TONY STARK,"Quantum fluctuation messes with the Planck Scale, which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition. Can we agree on that?"
215,STEVE ROGERS,Thank you.
216,TONY STARK,"In Layman's terms, it means you're not coming home."
217,SCOTT LANG,I did.
218,TONY STARK,"No, you accidentally survived. It's a billion to one cosmic fluke. And now you wanna pull off a... What do you call it?"
219,SCOTT LANG,A time heist?
220,TONY STARK,"Yeah, a time heist. Of course, why didn't we think of this before? Oh, because it's laughable? Because it's a pipedream?"
221,SCOTT LANG,The Stones are in the past. We can go back and get them.
222,NATASHA ROMANOFF,We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everyone back.
223,TONY STARK,"Or screw it up worse than he already has, right?"
224,STEVE ROGERS,I don't believe we would.
225,TONY STARK,"Gotta say, sometimes I miss that giddy optimism. However, high hopes won't help if there's no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said time heist. I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise."
226,SCOTT LANG,"Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel. That means no talking to our past selves, no betting on sporting events -"
227,TONY STARK,"I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott. Are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe is based on Back To The Future?"
228,SCOTT LANG,No.
229,TONY STARK,Good. You had me worried there. 'Cause that'd be horse shit. That's not how quantum physics works.
230,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Tony... We have to take a stand.
231,TONY STARK,"We did stand. And yet, here we are."
232,SCOTT LANG,"I know you got a lot on the line. You got a wife, a daughter. But I lost someone very important to me. A lot of people did.  And now, now we have a chance to bring her back. To bring everyone back. And you're telling me that won't even..."
233,TONY STARK,"That's right, Scott, I won't even. I got a kid."
234,MORGAN STARK,Mommy told me to come and save you.
235,TONY STARK,"Good job. I'm saved.  I wish you'd come here to ask me something else. Anything else. Honestly, I... I missed you guys, it was... Oh, and table's set for six."
236,STEVE ROGERS,"Tony, I get it. And I'm happy for you, I really am. But this is a second chance."
237,TONY STARK,"I got my second chance right here, Cap. I can't roll the dice again. If you don't talk shop, you can stay for lunch."
238,NATASHA ROMANOFF,He's scared.
239,STEVE ROGERS,He's not wrong.
240,SCOTT LANG,"Yeah, but I mean, what are we gonna do? We need him. What, are we gonna stop?"
241,STEVE ROGERS,"No, I wanna do it right. We're gonna need a really big brain."
242,SCOTT LANG,Bigger than his?
243,BRUCE BANNER,"Come on, I feel like I'm the only one eating.  Try some of that. Have some eggs."
244,SCOTT LANG,I'm so confused.
245,BRUCE BANNER,These are confusing times.
246,SCOTT LANG,"Right. No, no, that's not what I meant."
247,BRUCE BANNER,"No, I get it. I'm kidding! I know. It's crazy. I'm wearing shirts now."
248,SCOTT LANG,Yeah! Wh...How? Why?
249,BRUCE BANNER,"Five years ago, we got our asses beaten. Except it was worse for me. Because I lost twice. First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost. Then, we all lost."
250,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"No one blamed you, Bruce."
251,BRUCE BANNER,"I did. For years, I've been treating the Hulk like he's some kind of disease, something to get rid of. But then I started looking at him as the cure. Eighteen months in a gamma lab. I put the brains and the brawn together. And now look at me. Best of both worlds..."
252,GIRL,"Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?"
253,BRUCE BANNER,Yes?
254,GIRL,Can we get a photo?
255,BRUCE BANNER,"100%, little person. Come on, step up.  You mind?"
256,SCOTT LANG,"Oh, yeah."
257,BRUCE BANNER,"Thanks,"
258,BRUCE BANNER,Did you get that?
259,SCOTT LANG,Don't you wanna grab one with me? I'm Ant-Man.
260,SCOTT LANG,"They're Hulk fans, they don't know Ant-Man. Nobody does."
261,BRUCE BANNER,"Wait, no, no, he feels bad. No, he wants you to...he wants to..."
262,BOY,Stranger Danger.
263,SCOTT LANG,He's even saying no he doesn't. I get it. I don't want it either.
264,BRUCE BANNER,"But, come on, the kid! But he...but you..."
265,SCOTT LANG,I don't want a picture with them.
266,BRUCE BANNER,Sorry. They said they'd do it.
267,SCOTT LANG,I don't want it anymore.
268,BRUCE BANNER,"No, no...you feel bad."
269,SCOTT LANG,Just take the goddamn phone.

274,STEVE ROGERS,Bruce.
275,BRUCE BANNER,Listen to your Mom. She knows better.
276,STEVE ROGERS,About we were saying...
277,BRUCE BANNER,"Right. The whole time travel do-over? Guys, it's outside my area of expertise."
278,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Well, you pulled this off. I remember a time when that seemed pretty impossible time, too."
279,TONY STARK,"Look at a mod inspiration, let me see what check out. So, recommend one last sim before we pack it in for the night. This time, in the shape of a mobius strip, inverted, please."
280,F.R.I.D.A.Y,Processing...
281,TONY STARK,"Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle factoring, and a spectral decomp. That will take a second."
282,F.R.I.D.A.Y,Just a moment.
283,TONY STARK,And don't worry if it doesn't pan out. I'm just kinda -
284,F.R.I.D.A.Y,Model rendered.

288,MORGAN STARK,Shit.
289,TONY STARK,"No, we don't say that. Only Mommy says that word. She coined it, it belongs to her."
290,MORGAN STARK,Why you up?
291,TONY STARK,"'Cause I got some important shit going on here.  What do you think? No, I got something on my mind. I got something on my mind."
292,MORGAN STARK,Was it Juice Pops?
293,TONY STARK,"Sure was. That's extortion. Great minds think alike. Juice Pops, exactly was on...  my mind."
294,TONY STARK,"You done? Yeah, now you are.  That face goes there."
295,MORGAN STARK,Tell me a story.
296,TONY STARK,"A story... Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed. The end."
297,MORGAN STARK,That's a horrible story.
298,TONY STARK,"Come on, that's your favorite story. I love you tons."
299,MORGAN STARK,I love you 3000.
300,TONY STARK,"Go to bed. Or I'll sell all your toys. Night, night."
301,TONY STARK,"Not that it's a competition, but she loves me 3000. You were somewhere on the low 6 to 900 range."

304,TONY STARK,What's new with composting?

308,TONY STARK,Time travel.
309,PEPPER POTTS,"What? Wow... That's amazing, and... terrifying."
310,TONY STARK,That's right.
311,PEPPER POTTS,We got really lucky.
312,TONY STARK,"Yeah, I know."
313,PEPPER POTTS,A lot of people didn't.
314,TONY STARK,"No, I can't help everybody."
315,PEPPER POTTS,It sort a seems like you can.
316,TONY STARK,"Not if I stop. I can put a pin in it right now, and stop."
317,PEPPER POTTS,"Tony, trying to get you to stop has been one of the few failures of my life."
318,TONY STARK,I sometimes feel I should put it in a locked box and drop it at the bottom of a lake... go to bed.
319,PEPPER POTTS,But would you be able to rest?
320,BRUCE BANNER,"Okay, here we go. Time travel test number one. Scott, fire up the uhhh... the van thing."
321,STEVE ROGERS,"Breakers are set, emergency generators are on standby."
322,BRUCE BANNER,"Good. 'Cause if we blow the grid, I don't wanna lose Tiny here in the 1950's."
323,SCOTT LANG,Excuse me?
324,NATASHA ROMANOFF,He's kidding.  You can't say things like that!
325,BRUCE BANNER,Just... It was a bad joke.
326,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"You were kidding, right?"
327,BRUCE BANNER,"We're good! Get your helmet on, Scott. I'm gonna send you back a week, let you walk around for an hour, then bring you back in 10 seconds. Makes sense?"
328,SCOTT LANG,Perfectly not confusing
329,STEVE ROGERS,"Good luck, Scott. You got this."
330,SCOTT LANG,"You're right. I do, Captain America."

350,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Oh my god.
351,BRUCE BANNER,And... Kill it!
352,SCOTT LANG,Somebody peed my pants.
353,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Oh thank god.
354,SCOTT LANG,"But I don't know if it was ""baby"" me or ""old"" me...Or just ""me"" me."
355,BRUCE BANNER,Time travel!
356,BRUCE BANNER,What? I..I see this as an absolute win!
357,TONY STARK,Why the long face? Let me guess: He turned into a baby.
358,STEVE ROGERS,"Among other things, yeah. What are you doing here?"
359,TONY STARK,"That's the EPR Paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might've wound up pushing time through Lang. It's tricky. Dangerous. Somebody should've cautioned you against it."
360,STEVE ROGERS,You did.
361,TONY STARK,"Oh, did I?  Turns out, resentment is corrosive, and I hate it."
362,STEVE ROGERS,Me too.
363,TONY STARK,"We got a shot at getting these stones, but I gotta tell you my priorities: Bring back what we lost? I hope, yes. Keep what I got? I have to, at all costs. And... maybe not die trying will be nice."
364,STEVE ROGERS,Sounds like a deal.
365,STEVE ROGERS,Tony...
366,TONY STARK,"Why? He made it for you.  Plus, honestly I have to get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding."
367,STEVE ROGERS,"Thank you, Tony."
368,TONY STARK,"Will you keep that a little quiet? Didn't bring one for the whole team.  ...We are getting the whole team, yeah?"
369,STEVE ROGERS,We're working on that right now.
370,ROCKET,"Hey, humie! Where's Big Green?"
371,SCOTT LANG,"Uh, Kitchen, I think.  That's awesome."
372,NEBULA,"Rhodey, careful on re-entry. There's an idiot on the landing zone."
373,SCOTT LANG,"Oh, God!"
374,RHODEY,"What's up, regular sized man?"
375,ROCKET,Kind of a step down from a from a golden palace for an Avenger highness and whatnot.
376,BRUCE BANNER,"Hey, have a little compassion, pal. First they've lost Asgard, then half the people. They're probably just happy to have a home."
377,VALKYRIE,You shouldn't have come!
378,BRUCE BANNER,"Ah, Valkyrie! Great to see you, Angry Girl."
379,VALKYRIE,I think I liked you better either of the other ways.
380,BRUCE BANNER,This is Rocket.
381,ROCKET,How you doin'?
382,VALKYRIE,He won't see you.
383,BRUCE BANNER,"That bad, huh?"
384,VALKYRIE,"We only see him once a month, when he comes for...  ... supplies."
385,BRUCE BANNER,It's that bad.
386,VALKYRIE,Yeah.
387,ROCKET,What the...  Woo! Something died in here.
388,BRUCE BANNER,Hello? Thor?
389,THOR,Are you here about the cable?
390,THOR,"The Cinemax ran out about two weeks ago, and the sports were all kind of fuzzy."
391,BRUCE BANNER,Thor?
392,ROCKET,"No, I'm good. I'm good. That's not necessary."
393,THOR,"Hulk, you know my friends, Miek, Korg, right?"
394,KORG,Hey boys!
395,BRUCE BANNER,"Hey guys, long time no see."
396,KORG,"Beer's on the bucket. Feel free to log on to the Wi-Fi. No password, obviously.  Thor, he's back. The kid on the TV that called me a dickhead again."
397,THOR,NoobMaster.
398,KORG,"Yeah, NoobMaster69 called me a dickhead."
399,THOR,"Noobmaster? Yeah, it's Thor again. You know, the God of Thunder? Listen, buddy. If you don't log off this game immediately, I am gonna fly over to your house, come down to that basement you're hiding in, rip off your arms AND SHOVE THEM UP YOUR BUTT!!! Oh, that's right. Yes, go cry to your father, you little weasel!"
400,KORG,"Thank you, Thor."
401,THOR,"Let me know if he bothers you again, okay?"
402,KORG,Thank you very much. I will.
403,THOR,"So you guys want a drink? What are you drinking? We have beer, tequila, all sorts of things."
404,BRUCE BANNER,"Buddy, you all right?"
405,THOR,"​​​​​​Yes, I'm fine! Why, don't I look all right?"
406,ROCKET,You look like melted ice cream.
407,THOR,"So, what's up?"
408,BRUCE BANNER,We need your help. There might be a chance we could fix everything.
409,THOR,"What, like the cable?  Cause that's been driving me bananas for weeks."
410,BRUCE BANNER,Like Thanos.
411,THOR,Don't say that name.
412,KORG,"Um, yeah. We don't actually say that name in here."
413,BRUCE BANNER,"Now, I know that... guy might scare you."
414,THOR,"Why would I be? Why would, why would I be scared of that guy? I'm the one who killed that guy, remember? Anyone else here killed that guy? Nope. Didn't think so. Korg, why don't you, tell everybody who chopped Thanos' big head off."
415,KORG,Umm... Stormbreaker?
416,THOR,"Now, who's swingin' Stormbreaker?"
417,BRUCE BANNER,"I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay? I've been there myself. You wanna know who helped me out of it?"
418,THOR,I don't know. Is it... Natasha?
419,BRUCE BANNER,It was you. You helped me.
420,THOR,"The ones that are left, anyway."
421,BRUCE BANNER,I think we can bring them back.
422,THOR,"Stop. stop, okay?  I know you think I'm down here wallowing in my own self-pity, waiting to be rescued and and saved. But I'm fine, okay? We're fine, aren't we?"
423,KORG,"Nah, all good here, mate."
424,THOR,"So, whatever it is that you're offering, we're not into it, don't care, couldn't care less. Goodbye."
425,BRUCE BANNER,"We need you, pal."
426,ROCKET,There's beer on the ship.
427,THOR,What kind?
428,[SCREEN TITLE,TOKYO]
429,THUG #1,あいつだ! アキヒコさんを！
430,AKIHIKO,てめえ なぜこんなことをする? 俺たちてめえになにもしてねぇだろ！
431,RONIN,地球の半分 サノスにやられた... お前はなぜ無事なの…
432,RONIN,お前はもう十分殺しただろ You're done hurting people.
433,AKIHIKO,
434,AKIHIKO,死ね!
435,AKIHIKO,待て! 助けてくれ! お前に何でもやる! 何が欲しい?
436,RONIN,What I want... You can't give me.
437,CLINT BARTON,You shouldn't be here.
438,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Neither should you.
439,CLINT BARTON,I've got a job to do.
440,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Is that what you're calling this? Killing all these people isn't gonna bring your family back.
441,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"We found something. A chance, maybe..."
442,CLINT BARTON,Don't...
443,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Don't what?
444,CLINT BARTON,...don't give me hope.
445,NATASHA,I'm sorry I couldn't give it to you sooner.
446,TONY STARK,"Ratchet, How's it going?"
447,ROCKET,"It's Rocket. Take it easy. You're only a genius on Earth, pal."
448,RHODEY,Time travel suit? Not bad.
449,SCOTT LANG,"Hey, hey, hey! Easy, easy!"
450,BRUCE BANNER,I'm being very careful.
451,SCOTT LANG,"No, you're being very Hulky."
452,BRUCE BANNER,I'm being careful.
453,SCOTT LANG,"These are Pym Particles, alright? And ever since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, this is it. This is what we have. We're not making any more."
454,RHODEY,"Scott, calm down."
455,SCOTT LANG,Sorry. We've got enough for one round trip each. That's it. No do-overs. Plus two test runs.  One test run.
456,SCOTT LANG,All right. I'm not ready for this.
457,CLINT BARTON,I'm game. I'll do it.
458,BRUCE BANNER,"Clint, now you're gonna feel a little discombobulated from the chronoshift. Don't worry about it."
459,RHODEY,"Wai-Wait a second, let me ask you something. If we can do this, you know, go back in time, why don't we just find baby Thanos, you know, and..."
460,BRUCE BANNER,"First of all, that's horrible..."
461,RHODEY,It's Thanos.
462,BRUCE BANNER,"...And secondly, time doesn't work that way. Changing the past doesn't change the future."
463,SCOTT LANG,"Look, we go back, we get the stones before Thanos gets them... Thanos doesn't have the stones. Problem solved."
464,CLINT BARTON,Bingo.
465,NEBULA,That's not how it works.
466,CLINT BARTON,"Well, that's what I heard."
467,BRUCE BANNER,What? By who? Who told you that?
468,RHODEY,"Star Trek, Terminator, TimeCop, Time After Time -"
469,SCOTT LANG,Quantum Leap -
470,RHODEY,"A Wrinkle in Time, Somewhere in Time -"
471,SCOTT LANG,Hot Tub Time Machine -
472,RHODEY,"Hot Tub Time Machine. Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Basically, any movie that deals with time travel."
473,SCOTT LANG,"Die Hard? No, it's not one..."
474,RHODEY,This is known.
475,BRUCE BANNER,"I don't know why everyone believes that, but that isn't true. Think about it: If you travel to the past, that past becomes your future. And your former present becomes the past. Which can't now be changed by your new future..."
476,NEBULA,Exactly.
477,SCOTT LANG,So... Back To The Future's a bunch of bullshit?
478,BRUCE BANNER,"Alright, Clint. We're going in 3... 2... 1!"
479,LILA BARTON,Cooper? Where are my headphones?
480,CLINT BARTON,
481,LILA BARTON,"Yeah, Dad?  Dad?"
482,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Hey, hey. Look at me. You okay?"
483,CLINT BARTON,"Yeah, it worked. It worked."
484,STEVE ROGERS,"Okay, so the ""how"" works. Now we gotta figure out the when and the where. Almost all of us has had an encounter with at least one of the six Infinity Stones."
485,TONY STARK,Well I'd substitute the word encounter for damn well near been killed by one of the six Infinity Stones.
486,SCOTT LANG,"I haven't, I don't even know what the hell you're all talking about"
487,BRUCE BANNER,"Regardless, we only have enough Pym Particles for one round trip each, and these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history."
488,TONY STARK,"Our history. So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in."
489,CLINT BARTON,Which means we have to pick our targets.
490,TONY STARK,Correct.
491,STEVE ROGERS,"Let's start with the Aether. Thor, what do you know?"
492,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Is he asleep?
493,RHODEY,"No, I'm pretty sure he's dead."
494,THOR,"Where to start? Umm... The Aether, first, is not a stone, someone called it a stone before. It's more of a... an angry sludge thing, so... someones gonna need to amend that. Here's an interesting story though, many years ago... My grandfather had to hide the stones from the Dark Elves...  I'm not done yet, the only thing permanent in life is impermanence."
495,TONY STARK,Awesome. Eggs? Breakfast?
496,THOR,"I'd like a Bloody Mary, thank you."
497,ROCKET,Quill said he stole the Power Stone from Morag.
498,SCOTT LANG,Is that a person?
499,ROCKET,Morag's a planet. Quill was a person.
500,SCOTT LANG,A planet? Like in outer space?
501,ROCKET,"Oh, look. It's like a little puppy, all happy and everything.  Do you wanna go to space? You wanna go to space, puppy? I'll get you to space."
502,NEBULA,Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.
503,NATASHA ROMANOFF,What is Vormir?
504,NEBULA,"A dominion of death, at the very center of Celestial existence. It's where... Thanos murdered my sister."
505,SCOTT LANG,Not it.
506,NATASHA ROMANOFF,That Time Stone guy...
507,BRUCE BANNER,Doctor Strange.
508,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Yeah, what kind of doctor was he?"
509,TONY STARK,Ear-nose-throat meets rabbit from a hat.
510,BRUCE BANNER,"Nice place in the village, though."
511,TONY STARK,Yeah. Sullivan Street.
512,BRUCE BANNER,Hmm... Bleecker.
513,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Wait, he lived in New York?"
514,TONY STARK,No. He lived in Toronto.
515,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Guys, if you pick the right year, there are three stones in New York."
516,BRUCE BANNER,Shut the front door.
517,STEVE ROGERS,"All right. We have a plan. Six Stones, three teams. One shot."
518,STEVE ROGERS,"Five years ago, we lost. All of us. We lost friends... We lost family... We lost a part of ourselves. Today, we have a chance to take it all back. You know your teams, you know your missions. Get the stones, get them back. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs. Most of us are going somewhere we know. But it doesn't mean we should know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives. And we're gonna win.  Whatever it takes. Good luck."
519,ROCKET,He's pretty good at that.
520,SCOTT LANG,Right?
521,TONY STARK,"All right. You heard the man. Stroke those keys, jolly green."
522,BRUCE BANNER,Tractors engaged.
523,ROCKET,"You promise to bring that back in one piece, right?"
524,CLINT BARTON,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. I'll do my best."
525,ROCKET,"As promises go, that was pretty lame."
526,NATASHA ROMANOFF,See you in a minute.
527,STEVE ROGERS,"All right, we all have our assignments. Two Stones uptown, one Stone, down. Stay low. Keep an eye on the clock."
528,STEVE ROGERS,Feel free to smash a few things along the way.
529,BRUCE BANNER,"I think it's gratuitous, but whatever."
530,THE ANCIENT ONE,I'd be careful going that way. We just had the floors waxed.
531,BRUCE BANNER,"Ma'am, I'm looking for Doctor Strange."
532,THE ANCIENT ONE,You're about... five years too early. Stephen Strange is currently performing surgery about twenty blocks that way. What do you want from him?
533,BRUCE BANNER,"That, actually."
534,THE ANCIENT ONE,Ah! I'm afraid not.
535,BRUCE BANNER,"Sorry, but I wasn't asking."
536,THE ANCIENT ONE,You don't wanna do this.
537,BRUCE BANNER,"Ah, you're right, I don't.  But I need that stone, and I don't have time to beat it-"
538,THE ANCIENT ONE,"Let's start over, shall we?"
539,THOR,That's Jane.
540,ROCKET,"All right. Here's the deal, Tubby: You're gonna charm her and I'm gonna poke her with this thing,  and extract the Reality Stone and get gone, lickety-split."
541,THOR,"I'll be right back, okay? There's a wine cellar, that's just down there. My father used to fish huge barrel of ale. I'll see if the cellar has a couple of..."
542,ROCKET,Hey! Hey! Aren't you drunk enough already?
543,ROCKET,Who's the fancy broad?
544,THOR,It's my Mother. She dies today.
545,ROCKET,Oh. That's today?
546,THOR,I can't do this. I can't do this. I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't have come.This was a bad idea.
547,ROCKET,Come here.
548,THOR,"No, no, no. I think I'm having...I'm having a panic attack. I shouldn't be here...this is...this is a bad-"
549,ROCKET,Come here. Right here.
550,ROCKET,"You think you're the only one who lost people? What do you think we're doing here? I lost the only family I ever had. Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna, all gone. Now, I get you miss your Mom. But she's gone. Really gone. And there are plenty of people who are only kinda gone. But you can help them. So is it too much to ask that you brush the crumbs outta your beard, make schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants, and when she's not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone and help me get my family back?"
551,THOR,Okay.
552,ROCKET,Are you crying?
553,THOR,No...Yes!
554,ROCKET,Get it together! You can do this. You can do this. All right?
555,THOR,"Yes, I can."
556,ROCKET,Good.
557,THOR,"I can do this. I can do it, I can't do this."
558,ROCKET,"Alright, Heartbreaker. She's alone. This is our shot.  Thor? Thor! Aaagh!!!"
559,RHODEY,"Alright. Bring it down low. Right on that line. That's it. Down, down."
560,CLINT BARTON,"Hey, can we hurry it up?"
561,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Guys, chop-chop. Come on. We're on a clock."
562,RHODEY,"All that, is really helpful.  Take care, okay?"
563,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Yeah.
564,RHODEY,Take that stone and come back. No messing around.
565,CLINT BARTON,Hey. You got this.
566,RHODEY,"Let's get it done. Yes, sir."
567,NATASHA ROMANOFF,See you back.
568,RHODEY,You guys watch each other's six.
569,CLINT BARTON,Yeah.
570,NEBULA,The coordinates for Vormir are laid in. All they have to do is not fall out.
571,CLINT BARTON,It's a long way from Budapest.
572,RHODEY,"Okay, so, uhh... We just wait around for this Quill guy to show up and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?"
573,NEBULA,Let's take cover. We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.
574,RHODEY,"Wait a minute, what are you talking about right now? Who else is looking for these stones?"
575,NEBULA,"My father, my sister... and me."
576,RHODEY,And you? Where are you right now?
577,GAMORA,You're welcome.
578,NEBULA,I didn't ask for your help.
579,GAMORA,"And yet, you always need it.  Get up. Father wants us back on the ship."
580,NEBULA,Why?
581,GAMORA,He's found an Infinity Stone.
582,NEBULA,Where?
583,GAMORA,On a planet called Morag.
584,NEBULA,Father's plan is finally in motion.
585,GAMORA,"One stone isn't six, Nebula."
586,NEBULA,It’s a start.
587,GAMORA,If he gets all of them...
588,THANOS,Ronan's located the Power Stone. I'm dispatching you to his ship.
589,GAMORA,He won't like that.
590,THANOS,"His alternative is death, then.  Ronan's obsession clouds his judgement."
591,NEBULA,"We will not fail you, Father."
592,THANOS,"No, you won't."
593,NEBULA,I swear...I will make you proud.
594,RHODEY,"We just, wait around for this Quill guy to show up, and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?"
595,NEBULA,Let's take cover. We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.
596,GAMORA,Who was that?
597,NEBULA,I don't know...My head is splitting...I don't know...
598,GAMORA,Her synaptic drive was probably damaged in battle.
599,THANOS,Shhh...  Bring her to my ship.
600,TONY STARK,"Got to hustle, Cap. Things look like they're just about wrapped up here."
601,STEVE ROGERS,Got it. I'm approaching the elevator now.
602,LOKI,If it's all the same to you... I'll have that drink now.
603,TONY STARK,"All right, get him on his feet. We can all stand around posing up a storm later. By the way, feel free to clean up."
604,TONY STARK,"Uh, Mr. Rogers. I almost forgot that that suit  did nothing for your ass."
605,STEVE ROGERS,"No one asked you to look, Tony."
606,TONY STARK,It's ridiculous
607,SCOTT LANG,"I think you look great, Cap. As far as I'm concerned, that's America's ass."
608,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Uhh, magic wand?"
609,TONY STARK,STRIKE team's coming to secure it.
610,SITWELL,We can take that  off your hands.
611,NATASHA ROMANOFF,By all means. Careful with that thing.
612,CLINT BARTON,Unless you want your mind erased. And not in a fun way.
613,SITWELL,We promise to be careful.
614,SCOTT LANG,Who are these guys?
615,TONY STARK,"They are SHIELD...Well, actually Hydra. But, we didn't know that yet."
616,SCOTT LANG,"Seriously, you didn't? I mean...they look like bad guys."
617,TONY STARK,"You're small, but you're talking loud."
618,STEVE ROGERS,On my way down to coordinate search and rescue.
619,LOKI,"I mean, honestly! How do you think you'll be..."
620,THOR,Shut up.
621,TONY STARK,"All right, you're up, little buddy.  There's our stone."
622,SCOTT LANG,Alright. Flick me.
623,HULK,Move.
624,THOR,Whoa!
625,TONY STARK,"Whoa, whoa. Hey! Buddy. What do you think? Maximum occupancy has been reached."
626,THOR,Take the stairs.
627,TONY STARK,Yeah.  Stop. Stop!
628,HULK,Take the stairs! Hate the stairs!
629,TONY STARK,"All right, Cap. I got our scepter in the elevator just passing the 80th floor."
630,STEVE ROGERS,On it. Head to the lobby.
631,TONY STARK,Alright. I'll see you there.
632,SITWELL,"Evidence secure. We're en route to Dr. List. No. No hitches at all, Mr. Secretary."
633,SITWELL,Captain. I thought you were coordinating search and rescue?
634,STEVE ROGERS,Change of plans.
635,RUMLOW,"Hey, Cap."
636,STEVE ROGERS,Rumlow.  I just got a call from the Secretary. I'm gonna be running point on the scepter.
637,SITWELL,Sir? I don't understand.
638,STEVE ROGERS,We got word there may be an attempt to steal it.
639,RUMLOW,"Sorry, Cap. I can't give you the scepter."
640,SITWELL,I'm gonna have to call the Director.
641,STEVE ROGERS,That's okay. Trust me.  Hail Hydra.
642,HULK,So many stairs!
643,TONY STARK,"Thumbelina, do you copy? I've got eyes on the prize. It's go-time."
644,SCOTT LANG,Bombs away.  Is... is that Axe body spray?
645,TONY STARK,"Yeah, I had a can just for emergencies. Relax. Can we focus, please?"
646,SCOTT LANG,I'm going inside you. Now.
647,ALEXANDER PIERCE,May I ask you where you're going?
648,THOR,"To lunch and then Asgard. I'm sorry, you are?"
649,TONY STARK,"Alexander Pierce. He's the man, one of the folks behind Nick Fury."
650,ALEXANDER PIERCE,My friends call me Mr. Secretary. I'm gonna have to ask you to turn that prisoner over to me.
651,THOR,Loki will be answering to Odin himself.
652,ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Oh, he's gonna answer to us. Odin can have what's left. And I'm gonna need that case, that's been SHIELD property for over 70 years."
653,HYDRA AGENT,"Hand over the case, Stark."
654,TONY STARK,"All right, move it, Stuart Little. Things are getting dicey up here. Let's go."
655,TONY STARK,"I'm not gonna argue who's got the higher authority here, all right?"
656,SCOTT LANG,You promise me you won't die?
657,TONY STARK,You're only giving me a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.
658,SCOTT LANG,That doesn't sound mild.
659,ALEXANDER PIERCE,I need the case.
660,TONY STARK,I know you got a lotta pull. I'm just saying...
661,ALEXANDER PIERCE,Okay. Then give me the case.
662,TONY STARK,"Do it, Lang!"
663,TONY STARK,Get your hands off!
664,TONY STARK,Window's closing. Pull my pin!
665,SCOTT LANG,Here goes!
666,ALEXANDER PIERCE,Stark?
667,THOR,Stark!
668,ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Look, he's convulsing. Give him air! Medic!"
669,TONY STARK,"MEDIC! You guys, some help!"
670,ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Stark, you--- your chest machine?"
671,TONY STARK,Good job. Meet me in the alley. I'm gonna grab a quick slice.
672,HULK,NO STAIRS!!!!
673,THOR,"You'll be fine, Stark. Stay with us! I'll try something, okay? I have no idea if it's gonna work."
674,THOR,YES!
675,TONY STARK,That worked a treat. That was so crazy!
676,THOR,I had no idea if that was gonna work.
677,TONY STARK,The case?
678,THOR,"The case. It's, uhh... Where's the case? Where's Loki? Loki!"
679,SCOTT LANG,"That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?"
680,TONY STARK,"Oh, we blew it."
681,THOR,Loki!?
682,STEVE ROGERS,"Tony, what's going on? Tell me you found that cube.  Oh, you gotta be shitting me."
683,STEVE ROGERS,I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor.
684,STEVE ROGERS,I'm not Loki. And I don't wanna hurt you.
685,STEVE ROGERS,I can do this all day.
686,STEVE ROGERS,"Yeah, I know. I know."
687,STEVE ROGERS,Where did you get this?
688,STEVE ROGERS,Bucky... is... alive!
689,STEVE ROGERS,What?
690,STEVE ROGERS,That is America's ass.
691,BRUCE BANNER,"Please, please!"
692,THE ANCIENT ONE,"I'm sorry, I can't help you, Bruce. If I give up the Time Stone to help your Reality, I'm dooming my own."
693,BRUCE BANNER,"With all due respect, I'm not sure the science really supports that."
694,THE ANCIENT ONE,"The Infinity Stones create what you experience as the flow of time. Remove one stone and that flow splits.  Now, this may benefit your reality, but my new one…not so much. In this new branched Reality, without our chief weapon against the forces of darkness, our world will be overrun. Millions will suffer. So, tell me, Doctor, can your science prevent all that?"
695,BRUCE BANNER,"No, but we can erase it. Because once we are done with the stones, we can return each one to its own timeline at the moment it was taken. So, chronologically,  it never left."
696,THE ANCIENT ONE,"But you are leaving out the most important part. In order to return the stones, you have to survive."
697,BRUCE BANNER,We will. I will. I promise.
698,THE ANCIENT ONE,I can't risk this Reality on a promise. It is the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time Stone.
699,BRUCE BANNER,"Then, why the hell did Strange give it away?"
700,THE ANCIENT ONE,What did you say?
701,BRUCE BANNER,"Strange, he gave it away. He gave it to Thanos."
702,THE ANCIENT ONE,Willingly?
703,BRUCE BANNER,Yes!
704,THE ANCIENT ONE,...Why?
705,BRUCE BANNER,I have no idea. Maybe he made a mistake.
706,THE ANCIENT ONE,Or I did.  Strange is meant to be the best of us.
707,BRUCE BANNER,So he must have done it for a reason.
708,THE ANCIENT ONE,I fear you might be right.
709,BRUCE BANNER,Thank you.
710,THE ANCIENT ONE,"I'm counting on you, Bruce. We all are."
711,THANOS,Run diagnostics. Show me her memory file.
712,EBONY MAW,"Sire, the file appears entangled. It was a memory, but not hers. There's another consciousness sharing her network...another Nebula."
713,THANOS,Impossible.
714,EBONY MAW,This duplicate carries a time stamp... from nine years in the future.
715,THANOS,Where is this other Nebula?
716,EBONY MAW,In our solar system. On Morag.
717,THANOS,Can you access her?
718,EBONY MAW,Yes. The two are linked.
719,THANOS,Search the duplicate's memories for Infinity Stones.
720,BRUCE BANNER,And these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history.
721,TONY STARK,"Our history. So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in."
722,CLINT BARTON,Which means we have to pick our targets.
723,TONY STARK,Correct.
724,THANOS,Freeze image.
725,GAMORA,Terrans.
726,THANOS,"Avengers. Unruly wretches. What's that reflection? Amplify this, Maw."
727,GAMORA,I don't understand. Two Nebulas.
728,THANOS,No. The same Nebula. From two different times. Set course for Morag. Scan the duplicate's memories. I want to see everything.
729,FRIGGA,"My ladies, I'll see you after. Go on."
730,FRIGGA,What are you doing?
731,THOR,Aah!!!
732,FRIGGA,Aah!!!
733,THOR,"OH, God!"
734,FRIGGA,You're better off leaving the sneaking to your brother.
735,THOR,"Yeah, I was simply just going for a walk, and uh..."
736,FRIGGA,What are you wearing?
737,THOR,I always wear this. This is one of my favorites.
738,FRIGGA,What's wrong with your eye?
739,THOR,"Oh, my eye. That's... you remember the Battle of Haroquin? When I got hit in the face with a broadsword?"
740,FRIGGA,"You're not the Thor I know at all, are you?"
741,THOR,"Yes, I am."
742,FRIGGA,"The future hasn't been kind to you, has it?"
743,THOR,I didn't say I'm from the future.
744,FRIGGA,"I was raised by witches, boy. I see with more than eyes, and you know that."
745,THOR,"I am totally, totally from the future."
746,FRIGGA,"Yes, you are."
747,THOR,I really need to talk to you.
748,FRIGGA,We can talk.
749,THOR,His head was over there... His body over there... What was the point? I was too late. I was just standing there. Some idiot with an axe.
750,FRIGGA,You're no idiot. You're here aren't you? Seeking counsel from the wisest person in Asgard.
751,THOR,"I guess, yeah."
752,FRIGGA,Idiot? No. A failure? Absolutely.
753,THOR,That's a little bit harsh.
754,FRIGGA,You do know what that makes you? Just like everyone else.
755,THOR,"I'm not supposed to be like everyone else, am I?"
756,FRIGGA,"Everyone fails at who they are supposed to be, Thor. The measure of a person, of a hero, is how well they succeed at being who they are."
757,THOR,"I really missed you, Mum."
758,ROCKET,Thor! I got it!
759,ASGARDIAN SOLDIER,Get that rabbit!
760,THOR,"Ma, I have to tell you something."
761,FRIGGA,"No, son. You don't. You're here to repair your future, not mine."
762,THOR,But this is about your future.
763,FRIGGA,It's none of my business.
764,ROCKET,"Hey. You must be Mom. I got the thing. Come on, we got to move."
765,THOR,I wish we had more time.
766,FRIGGA,"No, this was a gift. And you're going to be the man you're meant to be."
767,THOR,"I love you, Mom."
768,FRIGGA,I love you. And eat a salad.
769,ROCKET,Come on. We gotta go.
770,FRIGGA,Goodbye.
771,ROCKET,Three... two...
772,THOR,"No, wait!"
773,ROCKET,Wh- what am I looking at?
774,FRIGGA,"Oh, sometimes it takes a second."
775,THOR,I'm still worthy.
776,ROCKET,"Oh, boy."
777,THOR,"Goodbye, Mom."
778,FRIGGA,Goodbye.
779,RHODEY,So he's an idiot?
780,NEBULA,Yeah.
781,RHODEY,What's that?
782,NEBULA,The tool of a thief.
783,RHODEY,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...This is the part where spikes come out with skeletons on the end and everything..."
784,NEBULA,What are you talking about?
785,RHODEY,"When you break into a place called the temple of the Power Stone, There's gonna be a bunch of booby traps–"
786,RHODEY,Okay. All right. Go ahead.
787,NEBULA,I wasn't always like this.
788,RHODEY,"Me either. But we work with what we got, right?"
789,RHODEY,Sync up.  Three.. two.. one...
790,BRUCE,You murdered trillions!
791,THANOS,You should be grateful.
792,NATASHA,Where are the stones?
793,THANOS,Gone. Reduced to atoms.
794,BRUCE,You used them two days ago.
795,THANOS,I used the stones to destroy the stones. It nearly killed me. But the work is done. It always will be. I am inevitable.
796,GAMORA,What did you do to them?
797,THANOS,Nothing. Yet. They're not trying to stop something I'm going to do in our time. They're trying to undo something I've already done in theirs.
798,GAMORA,The stones...
799,THANOS,I found them all. I won. Tipped the cosmic scales to balance.
800,EBONY MAW,This is your future.
801,THANOS,It's my destiny.
802,NEBULA,My father is many things. A liar is not one of them.
803,THANOS,"Ah...Thank you, Daughter. Perhaps I treated you too harshly..."
804,THANOS,"And that, is destiny fulfilled."
805,EBONY MAW,"Sire, your Daughter..."
806,NEBULA,No!
807,EBONY MAW,...is a traitor.
808,NEBULA,That's not me. It's not. I could never...I would never betray you. Never.
809,THANOS,I know. And you'll have the chance to prove it.
810,NEBULA,"No! He knows!  Barton? Barton, come in. Romanoff? Come in, we have a problem. Come on! Come in, we have a prob....Thanos knows. Thanos… He knows."
811,TONY STARK,Cap–
812,TONY STARK,"Sorry, buddy. We got a– problem."
813,SCOTT LANG,"Huh. Yeah, we do."
814,STEVE ROGERS,"Well, what are we gonna do now?"
815,TONY STARK,"You know what? Give me a break, Steve. I just got hit in the head with the Hulk."
816,SCOTT LANG,You said that we had one shot. This– this was our shot. We shot it. It's shot. Six stones or nothing. Six stones or nothing–
817,TONY STARK,"You're repeating yourself, you know that? You're repeating yourself."
818,SCOTT LANG,You're repeating yourself. You're repeating yourself. You know– No.
819,TONY STARK,"Dude, come on."
820,SCOTT LANG,"You never wanted a time heist, you went on board with the time heist–"
821,TONY STARK,I dropped the ball.
822,SCOTT LANG,You ruined the time heist.
823,TONY STARK,Is that what I did?
824,SCOTT LANG,Yeah!
825,STEVE ROGERS,Are there any other options with the Tesseract?
826,SCOTT LANG,"No, no, no. There's no other options. There's no do-overs. We're not going anywhere else. We have one particle left. Each. That's it, alright? We use that– Bye, bye. You're not going home."
827,STEVE ROGERS,"Yeah, well if we don't try, then no one else is going home, either."
828,TONY STARK,"I got it. There's another way. To retake the Tesseract and acquire new particles. We'll stroll down memory lane. Military installation, Garden State."
829,STEVE ROGERS,When were they both there?
830,TONY STARK,They were there at a– I've a vaguely exact idea.
831,STEVE ROGERS,How vague?
832,SCOTT LANG,What are you talking about? Where are we going?
833,TONY STARK,I know for a fact they were there–
834,SCOTT LANG,Who's they? What are we doing?
835,TONY STARK,And I know how I know.
836,SCOTT LANG,"Guys, what's up? What is it?"
837,TONY STARK,"Well, it looks like we're improvising."
838,SCOTT LANG,Right. What are we improvising?
839,TONY STARK,"Scott, get this back to the compound."
840,TONY STARK,Suit up.
841,SCOTT LANG,What's in New Jersey?
842,TONY STARK,"0-4,"
843,STEVE ROGERS,0-4–-
844,TONY STARK,"Uhh, 0-7."
845,STEVE ROGERS,0-7.-
846,SCOTT LANG,Excuse me...
847,TONY STARK,1-9-7-0.
848,STEVE ROGERS,Are you sure?
849,SCOTT LANG,"Cap. Captain. Steve, sorry, America. Rogers. Look,if you do this, and this doesn't work,you're not coming back."
850,TONY STARK,"Thanks for the pep talk, pissant. Do you trust me?"
851,STEVE ROGERS,I do.
852,TONY STARK,Your call.
853,STEVE ROGERS,Here we go.
854,"OUR WATCHER INFORMANT, STAN LEE","Hey, man! Make love, not war!"
855,TONY STARK,"Clearly, you weren't actually born here, right?"
856,STEVE ROGERS,The idea of me was.
857,TONY STARK,"Right. Well, imagineyou're SHIELD, running a quasi-fascisticintelligence organization. Where do you hide it?"
858,STEVE ROGERS,In plain sight.
859,TONY STARK,"Good luck on yourmission, Captain."
860,STEVE ROGERS,"Good luck on yourproject, doctor."
861,ELEVATOR LADY,You're new here?
862,STEVE ROGERS,Not exactly.
863,TONY STARK,Gotcha. Back in the game.
864,HOWARD STARK,"Arnim, you in there? Arnim? Hey! Door's this way, pal."
865,TONY STARK,"Oh, yeah."
866,HOWARD STARK,I'm looking for Dr. Zola.Have you seen him?
867,TONY STARK,"Yeah, no, Dr. Zol– No, I haven't seen a soul.  Pardon me."
868,HOWARD STARK,Do I know you?
869,TONY STARK,"No, sir. I'm a– a visitor from MIT."
870,HOWARD STARK,Huh. MIT. Got a name?
871,TONY STARK,Uh– Howard.
872,HOWARD STARK,"Well, that'll beeasy to remember."
873,TONY STARK,Howard– Potts.
874,HOWARD STARK,"Well, I'm Howard Stark."
875,TONY STARK,Hi.
876,HOWARD STARK,"Shake it, don't pull it."
877,TONY STARK,Yeah–
878,HOWARD STARK,"You look a little green aroundthe gills there, Potts."
879,TONY STARK,"I'm fine. Just, long hours."
880,HOWARD STARK,"Wanna get some air? Hello, Potts."
881,TONY STARK,Yeah. That would be swell.
882,HOWARD STARK,That way.
883,TONY STARK,Okay.
884,HOWARD STARK,Need your briefcase?
885,HOWARD STARK,"You're not one ofthose beatniks, are ya, Potts?"
886,CAPTAIN STEVENS,Hello. Dr. Pym?
887,HANK PYM,That would be the number that you called. Yes.
888,CAPTAIN STEVENS,This is Captain Stevens from shipping. We have a package for you.
889,HANK PYM,Bring it up.
890,CAPTAIN STEVENS,"Well, that's the thing, sir. We can't."
891,HANK PYM,I'm confused. I thought that was your job.
892,CAPTAIN STEVENS,"Well, it's just– Sir,the box is glowing and, to be honest, some of our mailguys aren't feeling that great."
893,HANK PYM,"They didn't open it, did they?"
894,CAPTAIN STEVENS,"Yeah, they did. You better get down here."
895,HANK PYM,Excuse me! Out of the way!
896,TONY STARK,"So, flowers and sauerkraut. Yougot a big date tonight?"
897,HOWARD STARK,"My wife's expecting. And, uh– Too muchtime in the office."
898,TONY STARK,Congratulations.
899,HOWARD STARK,"Thanks. Hold this, will you?"
900,TONY STARK,"Yeah, sure. How far along is she?"
901,HOWARD STARK,I don't know– Uh– She's at the point where she can't stand the sound of my chewing. I guess I'll be eatingdinner in the pantry again.
902,TONY STARK,I have a little girl.
903,HOWARD STARK,A girl would be nice. Less of a chanceshe'd turn out exactly like me.
904,TONY STARK,What'd be so awful about that?
905,HOWARD STARK,Let's just say that the greatergood has rarely outweighed my own self-interests.
906,SECURITY OFFICER,And you've never seen these two men before?
907,ELEVATOR LADY,"No, I've got an eye for this. The two of them looked fishy."
908,SECURITY OFFICER,Can you describe them?
909,ELEVATOR LADY,"Well, one of them had a hippie beard."
910,SECURITY OFFICER,Hippie? Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?
911,ELEVATOR LADY,Definitely Mungo Jerry.
912,SECURITY OFFICER,"Yeah, this is Chesler. Ineed every available MPs on sub-level 6. We havea potential breach."
913,TONY STARK,"So, where are youat with names?"
914,HOWARD STARK,"Well, if it's a boy, my wife likes Elmonzo."
915,TONY STARK,"Huh, Might wanna let that stew awwhile. You got time."
916,HOWARD STARK,Let me ask you a question. When your kid was born– were you nervous?
917,TONY STARK,Wildly. Yeah.
918,HOWARD STARK,Did you feel qualified? Like you had any idea how tosuccessfully operate that thing?
919,TONY STARK,"I literally pieced it together as I went along, I thought about what my Dad did, and–"
920,HOWARD STARK,"My old man, he never met a problem he couldn't solve with a belt."
921,TONY STARK,"I thought my dad was tough on me. And now, looking back, I just remember the good stuff, you know. He did drop the odd pearl."
922,HOWARD STARK,Yeah? Like what?
923,TONY STARK,"""No amount of money everbought a second of time."""
924,HOWARD STARK,Smart guy.
925,TONY STARK,He did his best.
926,HOWARD STARK,"Let me tell you. Thatkid's not even here yet, and there's nothing Iwouldn't do for him. Good to meet you, Potts."
927,TONY STARK,"Yeah, Howard– Everything's gonna be all right. Thank you– for everything– you've done for this country."
928,HOWARD STARK,"Jarvis, have we ever met that guy?"
929,EDWIN JARVIS,"You meet a lot of people, sir."
930,HOWARD STARK,Seems very familiar. Weird beard.
931,NEBULA,You're weak.
932,NEBULA,I'm you.
933,NEBULA,You can stop this. You know you want to. Did you see whathappens in the future? Thanos finds the Soul Stone. You wanna knowhow he does that? You wanna know whathe does to you?
934,NEBULA,That's enough.  You disgust me. But that doesn'tmean you're useless.
935,NEBULA,How do I look?
936,CLINT BARTON,"Wow– Under different circumstances, this would be totally awesome."
937,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I bet the raccoon didn'thave to climb a mountain.
938,CLINT BARTON,"Technically, he's nota raccoon, you know."
939,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Whatever. He eats garbage
940,RED SKULL,Welcome.
941,RED SKULL,"Natasha, daughter of Ivan. Clint, son of Edith."
942,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Who are you?
943,RED SKULL,"Consider me a guide. To you, and to all whoseek the Soul Stone."
944,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Oh, good. You tell us where it is.Then we'll be on our way."
945,RED SKULL,"Ah, liebchen– If only it were that easy."
946,RED SKULL,What you seek liesin front of you... as does what you fear.
947,NATASHA ROMANOFF,The stone is down there.
948,RED SKULL,"For one of you. For the other... In order to take the stone, youmust lose that which you love. An everlasting exchange. A soul, for a soul."
949,CLINT BARTON,How's it going? Jesus...Maybe he's making this shit up.
950,NATASHA ROMANOFF,No. I don't think so.
951,CLINT BARTON,"Why, 'cause he knows your Daddy's name?"
952,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I didn't. Thanos left here with the stone without his daughter. It's not a coincidence.
953,CLINT BARTON,Yeah.
954,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Whatever it takes.
955,CLINT BARTON,Whatever it takes.
956,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"If we don't get that stone, billions of people stay dead."
957,CLINT BARTON,Then I guess we both know who it's gotta be.
958,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I guess we do.
959,CLINT BARTON,"I'm starting to think– we mean different people here, Natasha."
960,NATASHA ROMANOFF,For the last five years I've been trying to do one thing: Get to right here. That's all it's been about. Bringing everybody back.
961,CLINT BARTON,"Oh, don't you get all decent on me now."
962,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"What, you think I wanna do it? I'm trying to save your life, you idiot."
963,CLINT BARTON,"Yeah, well, I don't want you to, because I– Natasha, you know what I've done. You know what I've become."
964,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I don't judge people ontheir worst mistakes.
965,CLINT BARTON,Maybe you should.
966,NATASHA ROMANOFF,You didn't.
967,CLINT BARTON,"You're a pain in my ass, you know that?"
968,CLINT BARTON,Okay. You win.
969,CLINT BARTON,Tell my family I love them.
970,NATASHA ROMANOFF,You tell them yourself.
971,CLINT BARTON,Damn you!
972,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Let me go.
973,CLINT BARTON,"No. Please, no."
974,NATASHA ROMANOFF,It's okay.
975,CLINT BARTON,Please–  NO!!!
976,BRUCE BANNER,Did we get them all?
977,RHODEY,You telling me this'llactually work?
978,BRUCE BANNER,"Clint, where's Nat?"
979,TONY STARK,Do we know if she had family?
980,STEVE ROGERS,Yeah. Us.
981,THOR,What?
982,TONY STARK,I just asked him a question–
983,THOR,"Yeah, you're acting like she's dead. Why are we acting like she's dead? We have the stones, right? As long as we have the stones, Cap, we can bring her back, isn't that right?  So stop this shit. We're the Avengers, get it together."
984,CLINT BARTON,We can't get her back.
985,THOR,Wha– what?
986,CLINT BARTON,It can't be undone. It can't.
987,THOR,"I'm sorry. No offense, but you'rea very earthly being. Okay? We're talking about space magic. And ""can't"" seems very definitive don't you think?"
988,CLINT BARTON,"Yeah, look, I know that I'm way outside my paygrade here. But she still isn't here, is she?"
989,THOR,"No, that's my point–"
990,CLINT BARTON,"It can't– be undone. Or that's at least what the red floating guy had to say.  Maybe you wanna go talk to him, okay? GO GRAB YOUR HAMMER, AND YOU GO FLY AND TALK TO HIM!"
991,CLINT BARTON,It was supposed to be me. She sacrificed her life for that goddamn stone. She bet her life on it.
992,BRUCE BANNER,She's not coming back. We have to make it worth it. We have to.
993,STEVE ROGERS,We will.
994,ROCKET,Boom!
995,ROCKET,"All right. The glove's ready. Question is, who's gonna snap their freaking fingers?"
996,THOR,I'll do it.
997,SCOTT LANG,Excuse me?
998,THOR,It's okay.
999,EVERYONE,"No, no, no, whoa. Stop. Stop. Wait a sec. Hey, hey–"
1000,STEVE ROGERS,"Wait, wait, Thor, just wait. We haven't decided who's gonna put that on yet."
1001,THOR,"I'm sorry. What, we're just sitting around waiting for the right opportunity?"
1002,SCOTT LANG,We should at least discuss it.
1003,THOR,"No, no, sitting here staring at that thing is not gonna bring everybody back. I'm the strongest Avenger, okay? So this responsibility falls upon me. It's my duty."
1004,TONY STARK,It's not about that–
1005,THOR,Just let me do it. Just let me do something good. Something right.
1006,TONY STARK,"Look– It's not just the fact that that glove is channeling enough energy to light up a continent, I'm telling you, you're in no condition."
1007,THOR,What do you– What do you think is coursing through my veins right now?
1008,RHODEY,Cheez Whiz?
1009,THOR,Lightning.
1010,TONY STARK,Yeah.
1011,BRUCE,"Lightning won't help you, pal. It's gotta be me."
1012,BRUCE BANNER,You saw what those stones did to Thanos. It almost killed him. None of you could survive.
1013,STEVE ROGERS,How do we know you will?
1014,BRUCE BANNER,We don't. But the radiation's mostly gamma.  It's like...I was made for this.
1015,TONY STARK,"Good to go, yeah?"
1016,BRUCE BANNER,Let's do it.
1017,TONY STARK,"You remember– everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago and just bringing them back to now, today. Don't change anything from the last five years."
1018,BRUCE BANNER,Got it.
1019,TONY STARK,"F.R.I.D.A.Y., do me a favor and activate Barn Door Protocol. Will you?"
1020,F.R.I.D.A.Y.,"Yes, boss."
1021,BRUCE BANNER,Everybody comes home.
1022,THOR,Take it off! Take it off!
1023,STEVE ROGERS,"No, wait. Bruce, are you okay?"
1024,TONY STARK,"Talk to me, Banner."
1025,BRUCE BANNER,I'm okay. I'm okay.
1026,STEVE ROGERS,Bruce!
1027,TONY STARK,Don't move him.
1028,BRUCE ROGERS,Did it work?
1029,THOR,Worth a shot. It's over. It's okay.
1030,CLINT BARTON,Honey. Honey.
1031,SCOTT LANG,Guys– I think it worked!
1032,ROCKET,I can't breathe. I can't breathe! I can't breathe.
1033,RHODEY,Canopy. Canopy. Canopy.
1034,BRUCE BANNER,"Rhodey, Rocket, get outta here!"
1035,ROCKET,Hurry up! Hurry up! Come on!
1036,BRUCE BANNER,Rhodey!
1037,RHODEY,"Mayday, mayday! Does anybody copy? We're in the lower level, it's flooding!"
1038,SCOTT LANG,What?
1039,RHODEY,We're drowning! Does anybody copy? Mayday!
1040,SCOTT LANG,"Wait! I'm here! I'm here, can you hear me?"
1041,CLINT BARTON,Cap?
1042,CLINT BARTON,Damn.
1043,THANOS,Daughter.
1044,NEBULA,"Yes, Father."
1045,THANOS,"So, this is the future. Well done."
1046,NEBULA,"Thank you, Father. They suspected nothing."
1047,THANOS,The arrogant never do.
1048,THANOS,Go. Find the stones. Bring them to me.
1049,NEBULA,What will you do?
1050,THANOS,Wait.
1051,GAMORA,"Tell me something. In the future, what happens to you and me?"
1052,NEBULA,I tried to kill you. Several times.
1053,NEBULA,"But eventually,we become friends. We become sisters."
1054,GAMORA,Come on. We can stop him.
1055,TONY STARK,"Come on, buddy. Wake up. That's my man. You lose this again, I'm keeping it."
1056,STEVE ROGERS,What happened?
1057,TONY STARK,You messed with time.It tends to mess back. You'll see.
1058,TONY STARK,What's he been doing?
1059,THOR,Absolutely nothing.
1060,STEVE ROGERS,Where are the stones?
1061,TONY STARK,Somewhere under all this. All I know is he doesn't have them.
1062,STEVE ROGERS,So we keep it that way.
1063,THOR,"You know it's a trap, right?"
1064,TONY STARK,Yeah. And I don't much care.
1065,THOR,Good. Just as long we are all in agreement.  Let's kill him properly this time.
1066,THANOS,"You could not live with your own failure. And where did that bring you? Back to me. I thought by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive. But you’ve shown me that’s impossible. And as long as there are those that remember what was, there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be. They will resist."
1067,TONY STARK,Yep. We're all kinds of stubborn.
1068,THANOS,"I'm thankful. Because now, I knowwhat I must do.  A grateful universe."
1069,STEVE ROGERS,Born out of blood.
1070,THANOS,They'll never know it. Because you won't bealive to tell them.
1071,RHODEY,"See you on the other side, man."
1072,SCOTT LANG,Hang on! I'm coming!
1073,CLINT BARTON,"Oh, hey– I know you."
1074,NEBULA,Father.
1075,NEBULA,I have the stones.
1076,CLINT BARTON,What?!
1077,GAMORA,Stop.
1078,NEBULA,You're betraying us?
1079,NEBULA,You don't have to do this.
1080,NEBULA,I am this.
1081,GAMORA,"No, you're not."
1082,NEBULA,You've seen what we become.
1083,GAMORA,"Nebula, listen to her."
1084,NEBULA,You can change.
1085,NEBULA,He won't let me.
1086,GAMORA,NO!
1087,TONY STARK,"Okay, Thor. Hit me."
1088,F.R.I.D.A.Y,"Boss, wake up!"
1089,THOR,I knew it!
1090,THANOS,"In all my years of conquest– violence– slaughter– It was never personal. But I'll tell you now– what I'm about to do to your stubborn, annoying little planet– I'm gonna enjoy it. Very, very much."
1091,SAM WILSON,"Hey, Cap, you read me?"
1092,SAM WILSON,"Cap, it's Sam. Can you hear me?"
1093,SAM WILSON,On your left.
1094,DOCTOR STRANGE,Is that everyone?
1095,WONG,"What, you wanted more?"
1096,STEVE ROGERS,AVENGERS!  –assemble.
1097,THOR,"No, no, give me that. You have the little one."
1098,PETER PARKER,"Hey! Holy cow! You will not believe what's been going on. Do you remember when we were in space? And I got all dusty? I must've passed out, Because I woke up, and you were gone. But Doctor Strange was there, right? He was like, ""It's been five years. Come on, they need us."" And then he started doing the yellow sparkly thing that he does all the time–"
1099,TONY STARK,"He did? Oh, God."
1100,PETER PARKER,What are you doing?
1101,PETER PARKER,"Oh, this is nice."
1102,PETER QUILL,Gamora?  I thought I lost you.
1103,PETER QUILL,Ow.
1104,GAMORA,me!
1105,PETER QUILL,You missed the first time– Then you got them both the second time.
1106,GAMORA,This is the one? Seriously?
1107,NEBULA,"The choices were him, or a tree."
1108,CLINT BARTON,"Cap, what do you want me to do with this damn thing?"
1109,STEVE ROGERS,Get those stones as far away as possible!
1110,BRUCE BANNER,No! We need to get them back where they came from.
1111,TONY STARK,No way to get them back. Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel.
1112,SCOTT LANG,Hold on!  That wasn't our only time machine.
1113,STEVE ROGERS,"Anyone see an ugly, brown van up there?"
1114,VALKYRIE,Yes! But you're not gonna like where it's parked!
1115,TONY STARK,"Scott, how long you need to get that thing working?"
1116,SCOTT LANG,Maybe ten minutes.
1117,STEVE ROGERS,Get it started. We'll get the stones to you.
1118,HOPE VAN DYNE,"We're on it, Cap."
1119,TONY STARK,"Hey. You said one out of 14 million, we win, yeah? Tell me this is it."
1120,DOCTOR STRANGE,"If I tell you what happens, it won't happen."
1121,TONY STARK,You better be right.
1122,THE WASP,It's a mess back here.
1123,SCOTT LANG,It's– it's dead.
1124,THE WASP,What?
1125,SCOTT LANG,It's dead. I have to hotwire it.
1126,THANOS,Where's Nebula?
1127,CORVUS GLAIVE,She's not responding.
1128,EBONY MAW,Sire!
1129,T'CHALLA,Clint! Give it to me.
1130,WANDA MAXIMOFF,You took everything from me.
1131,THANOS,I don't even know who you are.

1139,PETER PARKER,"I got this. I got this! Okay, I don't got this. Help! Somebody, help!"
1140,STEVE,"Hey, Queens, heads up."
1141,PEPPER POTTS,"Hang on. I got you, kid."
1142,PETER PARKER,"Hey! Nice to meet you– OH, MY GOD!"
1143,SAM,What the hell is this?
1144,TONY STARK,"F.R.I.D.A.Y., what are they firing at?"
1145,F.R.I.D.A.Y.,Something just entered the upper atmosphere.

1149,CAROL DANVERS,"Hey, Peter Parker. You got something for me?"
1150,PETER PARKER,I don't know how you're gonna get it through all that.
1151,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Don't worry.
1152,OKOYE,She's got help.
1153,"[Pepper lands next to Okoye, followed by Mantis, Shuri, the Wasp, 2014 Gamora and Nebula. Thanos' army charges while the women help Carol Danvers go through the Outriders, Sakaarans and Chitauri. 2014 Gamora takes out a gorilla, while Okoye takes out Corvus Glaive. Wanda and Valkyrie destroy two leviathans. Carol Danvers then starts flying towards the van with the Gauntlet, flying past enemies and going through enemy blockades that are in her way with ease. Thanos, seeing this, starts running to Carol Danvers, but is stopped by Pepper, Shuri and The Wasp, who blast him backwards. Thanos, after seeing Carol Danvers fly past him, throws his double sword at the van, destroying it and the quantum realm tunnel, throwing Carol Danvers backwards and losing her grip on the Gauntlet, which falls to the ground. Doctor Strange steadies the water after the explosion. In the final brawl for the Stark Gauntlet, Stark moves one of Thanos' enemies aside and sees the Gauntlet. He runs to get it, but sees Thanos, who Stark tackles. Thanos smacks Stark away, knocking him out. Then Thor arrives with Stormbreaker and 2013 Mjolnir in an attempt to pin Thanos' arm down, with assistance from Captain America. However, Thanos overpowers them and knocks them both out. After picking up the Gauntlet, Carol Danvers arrives, punching away at Thanos while he is holding the Gauntlet. She keeps punching him, but Thanos grabs her by the arm and flings her away. Thanos puts on the gauntlet, gamma radiation from the stones eating at him as he tries to snap, but Carol Danvers arises again, and stops his fingers from snapping, opening up his hand similar to what Captain America did in Avengers","Infinity War. Thanos headbutts her, but it does nothing. Just as Carol Danvers is gaining the upper hand by rising up and forcing Thanos onto his knees, Thanos pulls the Power Stone out of the Gauntlet and uses it in his free hand to hit Carol Danvers away. Stark looks in question at Strange, who simply raises one finger, reminding him that the one win over Thanos he foresaw is now at risk. Or is it? Stark nods. Thanos puts the Power Stone back into the Gauntlet, yelling from the gamma radiation coursing through him, until Stark makes one last attack on Thanos, pulling on the Gauntlet before Thanos punches him away.]"
1154,THANOS,I am– inevitable.
1155,TONY STARK,And I– am– Iron Man.
1156,PETER PARKER,Mr. Stark?
1157,PETER PARKER,I'm sorry– Tony–
1158,PEPPER POTTS,Hey.
1159,TONY STARK,"Hey, Pep.."

1161,F.R.I.D.A.Y.,Life functions critical.
1162,PEPPER POTTS,Tony. Look at me.  We're gonna be okay. You can rest now.
1163,TONY STARK,"Everybody wants a happy ending, right? But it doesn't always roll that way. Maybe this time. I'm hoping if you play this back, it's in celebration. I hope families are reunited, I hope we get it back, and something like a normal version of the planet has been restored. If there ever was such a thing. God, what a world. Universe, now. If you told me ten years ago that we weren't alone, let alone, you know, to this extent, I mean, I wouldn't have been surprised. But come on, you know? The epic forces of darkness and light that have come into play. And, for better or worse, that's the reality Morgan's gonna have to find a way to grow up in."
1164,TONY STARK,"So I thought I'd probably better record a little greeting... In the case of an untimely death on my part. I mean, not that, death at any time isn't untimely. This time travel thing that we're gonna try and pull off tomorrow, it's– it's got me scratching my head about the survivability of it all. That's the thing. Then again, that's the hero gig. Part of the journey is the end.  I love you 3,000."
1165,CLINT,"You know, I wish there was a way– that I could let her know. That we won.  We did it."
1166,WANDA MAXIMOFF,She knows– They both do.

1168,MORGAN STARK,Good.
1169,HAPPY,You good? Okay. You hungry?
1170,MORGAN STARK,Mm. Hm.
1171,HAPPY,What do you want?
1172,MORGAN STARK,Cheeseburgers.
1173,HAPPY,You know your dad liked cheeseburgers? I'm gonna get you all the cheeseburgers you want.
1174,MORGAN STARK,Okay.
1175,VALKYRIE,"So, when can we expect you back?"
1176,THOR,Um– about that–
1177,VALKYRIE,Thor. Your people need a king.
1178,THOR,"No, they already have one."
1179,VALKYRIE,That's funny. You're being serious?
1180,THOR,"It's time for me to be who I am rather than who I'm supposed to be. But you, you're a leader. That's who you are."
1181,VALKYRIE,You know I'd make a lot of changes around here.
1182,THOR,I'm counting on it. Your Majesty.
1183,VALKYRIE,What will you do?
1184,THOR,"I'm not sure. For the first time in a thousand years, I– I have no path. I do have a ride, though."

1188,THOR,"I know. I know. Of course, you are. Of course."
1189,QUILL,"See, you say of course, but then you touch the map. It makes you think that maybe you didn't realize I was in charge."
1190,THOR,Quail– you– that– that's your own–
1191,QUILL,Quail?
1192,THOR,–insecurities in there. Okay? I'm merely trying to be of service and assisting.
1193,QUILL,It's Quill.
1194,THOR,That's what I said.
1195,DRAX,You should fight one another for the honor of leadership.
1196,NEBULA,Sounds fair.
1197,QUILL,It's not necessary.
1198,THOR,It's not.
1199,QUILL,Okay?
1200,ROCKET,"I got some blasters, unless you guys wanna use knives."
1201,MANTIS,"Oooh, yes. Please, use knives."
1202,DRAX,"Yeah, knives."
1203,GROOT,I am Groot.
1204,QUILL,Not necessary...
1205,THOR,There shall be no knifing one another. Everybody knows who's in charge.
1206,QUILL,"Me, right?"
1207,THOR,"Yes, you. Of course. Of course. Of course."
1208,BRUCE BANNER,"Now, remember– You have to return the stones to the exact moment you got them. Or you're gonna open up a bunch of nasty alternative realities."
1209,STEVE ROGERS,"Don't worry, Bruce. Clip all the branches."
1210,BRUCE BANNER,"You know, I tried. When I had the gauntlet, the stones, I really tried to bring her back.  I miss her, man."
1211,STEVE ROGERS,"Me, too."
1212,SAM WILSON,"You know, if you want, I can come with you."
1213,STEVE ROGERS,"You're a good man, Sam. This one's on me, though."

1215,BUCKY BARNES,How can I? You're taking all the stupid with you.
1216,BUCKY BARNES,"Gonna miss you, Buddy."
1217,STEVE ROGERS,"It's gonna be okay, Buck."
1218,SAM WILSON,How long is this gonna take?
1219,BRUCE BANNER,For him? As long as he needs. For us? Five seconds.
1220,BRUCE BANNER,"Ready, Cap? Alright. We'll meetyou back here, okay?"
1221,STEVE ROGERS,You bet.
1222,BRUCE BANNER,"Going quantum. Three, two, one–"
1223,BRUCE BANNER,"And returning in, five, four, three, two, one–"
1224,SAM WILSON,Where is he?
1225,BRUCE BANNER,I don't know. He blew right by his time stamp. He should be here.
1226,SAM WILSON,"Well, get him back."
1227,BRUCE BANNER,I'm trying.
1228,SAM WILSON,Get him the hell back!
1229,BRUCE BANNER,"Hey, I said, I'm trying!"
1230,BUCKY BARNES,Sam...
1231,BUCKY BARNES,Go ahead.
1232,SAM WILSON,Cap?
1233,STEVE ROGERS,"Hi, Sam."
1234,SAM WILSON,"So did something go wrong, or did something go right?"
1235,STEVE ROGERS,"Well, after I put the stones back, I thought, maybe I'll try some of that life Tony was telling me to get."
1236,SAM WILSON,How'd that work out for you?
1237,STEVE ROGERS,It was beautiful.
1238,SAM WILSON,I'm happy for you. Truly.
1239,STEVE ROGERS,Thank you.
1240,SAM WILSON,Only thing bumming me out is the fact I have to live in a world without Captain America.
1241,STEVE ROGERS,"Oh, That reminds me.  Try it on."
1242,STEVE ROGERS,How does it feel?
1243,SAM WILSON,Like it's someone else's.
1244,STEVE ROGERS,It isn't.
1245,SAM WILSON,Thank you. I'll do my best.

47,Tony Stark,"Okay, and then you're like, 'Oh my god, there's no bathroom, what am I gonna do?', 'Oh! Someone's watching,' ''m gonna go in my pants.'"

49,Tony Stark,Yes.
50,Pepper Potts,Yeah. Everybody has that.
51,Tony Stark,"Right! That's the point I'm trying to make. Apropos of that, last night, I dreamt, we had a kid. So real. We named him after your eccentric uncle. Uh, what was his name?"

134,"School Bus Driver, Stan Lee",What's the matter with you kids? You've never seen a spaceship before?
135,Tony Stark,"F.R.I.D.A.Y., evac anyone south of 43rd Street, notify first responders."
136,F.R.I.D.A.Y.,Will do.
137,Ebony Maw,"Hear me, and rejoice. You are about to die at the hands of the Children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now contributing to..."
138,Tony Stark,"I'm sorry, Earth is closed today. You better pack it up and get outta here."
139,Ebony Maw,Does this chattering animal speak for you?
140,Stephen Strange,Certainly not. I speak for myself.
141,Tony Stark,"It means get lost, Squidward!"
142,Ebony Maw,He exhausts me.
143,Cull Obsidian,
144,Ebony Maw,Bring me the Stone.
145,Cull Obsidian,
146,Tony Stark,"Banner, you want a piece?"
147,Bruce Banner,"No, not really, but when do I ever get what I want?"
148,Tony Stark,That's right.
149,Tony Stark,"Been a while. Good to have you, buddy."
150,Bruce Banner,"I just... I need to concentrate here for one second. Come on, come on, man."
151,Tony Stark,Where's your guy?
152,Bruce Banner,I don't know. We've sort been havin' a thing.
153,Tony Stark,There's no time for a thing.
154,Bruce Banner,I know.
155,Tony Stark,That's the thing right there. Let's go.
156,Tony Stark,"Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards."
157,Bruce Banner,"Tony, I'm sorry.  Either I can't or he won't--"
158,Tony Stark,"It's okay. Hey, stand down.  Keep an eye on him. Thank you."
159,Wong,I have him.
160,Bruce Banner,Damn it.
161,Bruce Banner,Where'd that come from?
162,Tony Stark,It's nano-tech. You like it? A little someth--
163,Stephen Strange,"Dr. Banner, if the rest of your green friend won't be joining us...."
164,Tony Stark,"Gotta get that stone outta here, now."
165,Stephen Strange,It stays with me.
166,Tony Stark,Exactly. Bye.
167,Bruce Banner,"Tony, you okay? How we doing? Good? Bad?"
168,Tony Stark,"Really, really good. Really good. Do you plan on helping out?"
169,Bruce Banner,I'm trying. He won't come out.
170,Tony Stark,Hammer.
171,Bruce Banner,Come out! Come out! Come out!
172,Hulk,
173,Bruce Banner,"What do you mean, ""no""?!"
174,Peter Parker,"Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?"
175,Tony Stark,"Kid, where'd you come from?"
176,Peter Parker,Field trip to MoMA.
177,Peter Parker,"What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?"
178,Tony Stark,He's from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.
179,Ebony Maw,Your powers are quaint. You must be popular with children.
180,Stephen Strange,It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.
181,Ebony Maw,Then I'll take it off your corpse.
182,Stephen Strange,You'll find... removing a dead man's spell... troublesome.
183,Ebony Maw,You'll only wish you were dead.  NO!
184,Tony Stark,"Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it."
185,Peter Parker,On it!
186,Peter Parker,Not cool!
187,Peter Parker,"Uhhh, Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up!"
188,Tony Stark,"Hang on, kid."
189,Tony Stark,
190,Tony Stark,"Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you."
191,Peter Parker,But you said save the wizard!  I can't breathe!
192,Tony Stark,You're too high up. You're running out of air.
193,Peter Parker,Yeah! That makes sense.
194,Peter Parker,"Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!"
195,Tony Stark,"Happy trails, kid. F.R.I.D.A.Y, send him home."
196,F.R.I.D.A.Y.,Yep.
197,Peter Parker,"OH, COME ON!"
198,F.R.I.D.A.Y.,"Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts."
199,Pepper Potts,"Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right? What's going on?"
200,Tony Stark,"Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we might have to push our 8:30 res."
201,Pepper Potts,Why?
202,Tony Stark,Just 'cause I'll... probably not make it back for a while.
203,Pepper Potts,Tell me you're not on that ship.
204,Tony Stark,Yeah.
205,Pepper Potts,"God, no. Please tell me you're not on that ship."
206,Tony Stark,"Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I don't know what to say."
207,Pepper Potts,"Come back here, Tony. I swear to God…."
208,Tony Stark,Pep….
209,Pepper Potts,Come back here right now! Come back!
210,F.R.I.D.A.Y.,"Boss, we're losing her. I'm going, too…."
211,Peter Parker,Oh my God!  I should have stayed on the bus....
212,Bruce Banner,Where you going?
213,Wong,The Time Stone's been taken. The Sanctum remains unguarded. What will you do?
214,Bruce Banner,I'm gonna make a call.
215,[Screen title,SPACE]
216,Peter Quill,"Sing it, Drax!"
217,Rocket,Why are we doing this again?
218,Gamora,"It's a distress signal, Rocket. Someone could be dying."
219,Rocket,"I get that, but why are we doing it?"
220,Peter Quill,'Cause we're nice. And maybe whoever it is will give us a little cheddar cheese  for our help.
221,Gamora,Which isn't the point.
222,Peter Quill,Which isn't the point... I mean… if he doesn't pony up….
223,Drax,We'll take his ship.
224,Rocket,Exactly!
225,Peter Quill,B-b-b-bingo!
226,Mantis,We are arriving.
227,Peter Quill,"All right, Guardians. Don't forget, this might be dangerous, so let's put on our mean faces.  Groot."
228,Groot,I am Groot!
229,Peter Quill,Whoa!
230,Rocket,Language!
231,Gamora,Hey!
232,Drax,Wow.
233,Peter Quill,"You got some acorns on you, kid."
234,Rocket,"Ever since you got a little sap, you're a total d-hole. Keep it up, and I'm gonna SMASH THAT THING TO PIECES!"
235,Mantis,What happened?
236,Rocket,Looks like we're not getting paid.
237,Rocket,Wipers! Wipers! Get it off!
238,Peter Quill,How the hell is this dude still alive?
239,Drax,"He is not a dude. You're a dude. This... this is a man. A handsome, muscular man."
240,Peter Quill,I'm muscular.
241,Rocket,"Who are you kidding, Quill? You're one sandwich away from fat."
242,Peter Quill,"Yeah, right."
243,Drax,It's true. You have gained a little weight….
244,Peter Quill,"What? Gamora, do you think I'm…"
245,Mantis,He is anxious. Angry. He feels tremendous loss and guilt.
246,Drax,It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel.
247,Peter Quill,Wow. This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay. I'm gonna get a Bow-flex. I'm gonna commit. I'm gonna get some dumbbells.
248,Rocket,"You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?"
249,Gamora,It's like his muscles are made of Cotati metal fibers.
250,Peter Quill,Wake him up.
251,Mantis,Wake.
252,Thor,Who the hell are you guys?
253,Gamora,"The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal: To bring balance to the Universe by wiping out half of all life. He used to kill people planet by planet, massacre by massacre...."
254,Drax,Including my own.
255,Gamora,"If he gets all six Infinity Stones, he can do it with the snap of his fingers, like this."
256,Thor,You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.
257,Drax,Gamora... is the daughter of Thanos.
258,Thor,Your father killed my brother.
259,Peter Quill,"Oh, boy. Stepfather. Technically, she hates him as much as you do."
260,Thor,"Families can be tough.  Before my father died, he told me I had a half-sister... that he imprisoned in Hel. Then she returned home, and stabbed me in the eye, so... I had to kill her. It's life, isn't it, I guess. Goes round and round and... I feel your pain."
261,Peter Quill,"And I feel your pain, as well. I mean it's not a competition, but I've been through a lot. My father killed my mother, then I had to kill my father. And that was hard. Probably even harder than having to kill a sister. Plus, I, came out of it with both of my eyes--"
262,Thor,"I need a hammer, not a spoon….  How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of a four-digit code maybe… maybe a birth date or something…."
263,Peter Quill,What are you doing?
264,Thor,Taking your pod.
265,Peter Quill,"You'll not, be taking our pod today, sir."
266,Rocket,Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?
267,Peter Quill,No.
268,Drax,You are. You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.
269,Peter Quill,No I'm not.
270,Mantis,He just did it again!
271,Peter Quill,This is my voice!
272,Thor,Are you mocking me?
273,Peter Quill,Are you mocking me?
274,Thor,Stop it. You did it again.
275,Peter Quill,He's trying to copy me.
276,Thor,Would you stop doing that? He's doing it first.
277,Gamora,Enough! We need to stop Thanos. Which means we need to find out where he's going next.
278,Thor,Knowhere.
279,Mantis,He must be going somewhere.
280,Peter Quill,
281,Thor,Not anymore.
282,Gamora,Thor… why would he go to Knowhere?
283,Thor,"Because for years, the Reality Stone has been safely stored, there with a man we call the Collector."
284,Peter Quill,"If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe. Only an idiot would give that man a stone."
285,Thor,Or a genius.
286,Gamora,How do you know he's not going for one of the other Stones?
287,Thor,"There's six stones out there.  Thanos already has the Power Stone because he stole it last week, when he decimated Xandar. He stole the Space Stone from me when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people. The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth. They're with the Avengers."
288,Peter Quill,The 'Avengers'?
289,Thor,Earth's Mightiest Heroes.
290,Mantis,Like Kevin Bacon?
291,Thor,"He may be on the team. I don't know. Haven't been there in a while. As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that. No one even knows where it is. Therefore, Thanos can't get it. Therefore, he's going to Knowhere. Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone. You're welcome."
292,Gamora,Then we have to go to Knowhere now.
293,Thor,"Wrong! Where we have to go, is Nivadellir."
294,Drax,That's a made up word.
295,Thor,All words are made up.
296,[It's official,mind blown.]
297,Rocket,"Hold up, Nidavellir is real?  They make the most powerful, horrific weapons to ever torment the Universe. I would very much like to go there, please."
298,Thor,"The rabbit is correct, and clearly the smartest among you."
299,Rocket,Rabbit?
300,Thor,"Only Eitri the dwarf king can make me the weapon I need.  I assume you're the captain, sir?"
301,Rocket,You're very perceptive.
302,Thor,You seem like a noble leader. Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?
303,Rocket,"Lemme just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go."
304,Thor,Wonderful.
305,Peter Quill,Except for that I'm the captain.
306,Thor,Quiet!
307,Peter Quill,That's my backpack.
308,Rocket,Go sit down.
309,Peter Quill,"Wait, what kind of weapon are we talking about here?"
310,Thor,The Thanos killing kind.
311,Peter Quill,Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?
312,Thor,No. You simply lack the strength to wield them. Your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into the madness.
313,Rocket,Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?
314,Thor,A little bit. Yeah.
315,Gamora,"If we don't go to Knowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone, he'll be too powerful to stop."
316,Thor,He already is.
317,Rocket,"I got it figured out. We got two ships, and a large assortment of morons. So me and Groot will go with the pirate-angel here, and the morons will go to Knowhere to try and stop Thanos. Cool? Cool."
318,Thor,So cool.
319,Peter Quill,For the record… I know that you're only going with him because it's where Thanos isn't.
320,Rocket,"You know, you shouldn't talk that way to your captain, Quill.  Come on, Groot. Put that game down, you'll rot your brain."
321,Thor,"I bid you farewell and good luck, morons. Bye."
322,Vision,
323,Wanda Maximoff,Vis? Is it the stone again?
324,Vision,It's as if it's speaking to me.
325,Wanda Maximoff,What does it say?
326,Vision,I don't... I don't know. But something...
327,Vision,Tell me what you feel.
328,Wanda Maximoff,I just feel you.
329,Wanda Maximoff,So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow to give us more time together before you went back.
330,Vision,What if I miss that train?
331,Wanda Maximoff,There is an 11.
332,Vision,"What if I missed all the trains? What if this time, I didn't go back?"
333,Wanda Maximoff,You gave Stark your word.
334,Vision,I'd rather give it to you.
335,Wanda Maximoff,"There are people who are expecting me too, you know. We both made promises."
336,Vision,"Not to each other.  You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself -- I, I... I think..."
337,Wanda Maximoff,It works.
338,Vision,It works.
339,Vision,Then stay. Stay with me.
340,Vision,Or not. If I'm overstepping…
341,Wanda Maximoff,What are they?
342,Vision,What the stone was warning me about.  I have to go.
343,Wanda Maximoff,"No, Vision. Vision, if that's true… then maybe going isn't the best idea."
344,Vision,"Wanda, I…"
345,Wanda Maximoff,Vision!
346,Vision,The blade. It stopped me from phasing.
347,Wanda Maximoff,Is that even possible?
348,Vision,It isn't supposed to be.  I'm beginning to think... we should have stayed in bed.
349,Wanda Maximoff,Vis!
350,Corvus Glaive,"Give up the Stone, and she lives."
351,Wanda Maximoff,Hands off.
352,Wanda Maximoff,"Come on. Come on. Come on, you gotta get up. You gotta get up. Come on. Hey. Hey. We have to go."
353,Vision,Please. Please leave.
354,Wanda Maximoff,You asked me to stay.... I'm staying.
355,Vision,Please.
356,Wanda Maximoff,Get up.
357,Proxima Midnight,Get up.
358,Corvus Glaive,I can't.
359,Natasha Romanoff,We don't wanna kill you. But we will.
360,Proxima Midnight,You'll never get the chance again.
361,Sam Wilson,Can you stand?
362,Vision,"Thank you, Captain."
363,Steve Rogers,Let's get you on the jet.
364,Natasha Romanoff,"I thought we had a deal. Stay close, check in. Don't take any chances."
365,Wanda Maximoff,I'm sorry. We just wanted time.
366,Sam Wilson,"Where to, Cap?"
367,Steve Rogers,Home.
368,Gamora's Mother,Shh. We'll be safe. We'll be safe.
369,Child of Thanos,
370,Ebony Maw,Zehobereians…
371,Young Gamora,Mother! Where's my mother?!
372,Ebony Maw,"Choose a side, or die."
373,Young Gamora,Mother!
374,Ebony Maw,"One side is a revelation. The other, an honor known only to a few."
375,Thanos,"What's wrong, little one?"
376,Young Gamora,My mother. Where is my mother?
377,Thanos,What's your name?
378,Young Gamora,Gamora.
379,Thanos,"You're quite the fighter, Gamora. Come. Let me help you.  Here. You try."
380,Ebony Maw,"Now go in peace, and meet your Maker."
381,Thanos,Concentrate. There! You've got it.
382,Peter Quill,"Gamora. Do you know if these grenades are the ""blow off your junk"" kind or the gas kind? 'Cause I was thinking I might hang a couple on my belt right here. But I don't want to--"
383,Gamora,I need to ask a favor.
384,Peter Quill,"Yeah, sure."
385,Gamora,"One way or another, the path that we're on leads to Thanos."
386,Peter Quill,Which is what the grenades are for.  I'm sorry. What's the favor?
387,Gamora,If things go wrong… If Thanos gets me… I want you to promise me… you'll kill me.
388,Peter Quill,What?
389,Gamora,I know something he doesn't. If he finds out… the entire Universe could be at risk.
390,Peter Quill,What do you know?
391,Gamora,"If I tell you, you'd know, too."
392,Peter Quill,"If it's so important, shouldn't I?"
393,Gamora,Only if you wanna die.
394,Peter Quill,Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario?
395,Gamora,"Just… trust me. And possibly, kill me."
396,Peter Quill,"I mean, I'd like to. I really would…"
397,Gamora,Swear to me. Swear to me on your mother.
398,Peter Quill,Okay.
399,Peter Quill,Dude. How long have you been standing there?
400,Drax,An hour.
401,Peter Quill,An hour? Are you serious?
402,Drax,I've mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still... that I become invisible to the eye... watch.
403,Peter Quill,You're eating a zarg-nut.
404,Drax,But my movement... was so slow... that it's imperceptible.
405,Peter Quill,"Mmm, no."
406,Drax,I'm sure I'm invisible.
407,Mantis,"Hi, Drax."
408,Drax,Damn it.
409,[The Benatar flies towards a massive skull and flies through one eye-hole into a vast interior cavern. Screen title,KNOWHERE.]
410,Peter Quill,This place looks deserted.
411,Drax,I'm reading movement from the third quadrant.
412,Peter Quill,"Yep. I'm picking that up, too. Let's put it down right here."
413,Collector,I don't have it.
414,Thanos,Everyone in the Galaxy knows you'd sell your own brother if you thought it would add the slightest trinket to your pathetic collection.
415,Thanos,"I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan. Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering."
416,Collector,I told you. I sold it. Why would I lie?
417,Thanos,I imagine it's like breathing for you.
418,Collector,Like suicide.
419,Thanos,So you do understand. Not even you would surrender something so precious.
420,Collector,I didn't know what it was.
421,Thanos,"Then you're more of a fool than I took you for. Last chance, charlatan. Where's the Stone?"
422,Drax,Today...
423,Peter Quill,Drax. Drax.
424,Drax,...He pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.
425,Peter Quill,"Drax, waaaaait!  Drax, Drax, Drax. He doesn't have the Stone yet. We get it, and then we can stop him. We have to get the Stone first. Yeah."
426,Drax,No. No. For Ovette. For Camaria.
427,Mantis,Sleeeep.
428,Peter Quill,"Okay. Gamora, Mantis, you go right. I'm...  The other right!"
429,Thanos,Why?
430,Peter Quill,That was quick.
431,Collector,Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!
432,Thanos,"Is it sadness I sense in you, daughter? In my heart, I knew you still cared. But one ever knows for sure. Reality is often disappointing."
433,Thanos,"That is, it was. Now… reality can be whatever I want."
434,Gamora,You knew I'd come.
435,Thanos,"I counted on it. There's something we need to discuss, little one."
436,Drax,Thanos!
437,Peter Quill,"Let her go, Grimace!"
438,Gamora,Peter…
439,Peter Quill,I told you to go right.
440,Gamora,Now? Really?
441,Peter Quill,You let her go!
442,Thanos,"Ah, the boyfriend."
443,Peter Quill,I like to think of myself more as a Titan-killing long-term booty call. Let her go.
444,Gamora,Peter…
445,Peter Quill,Or I'm gonna blow that nut sack of a chin right off your face!
446,Gamora,Not him.
447,Gamora,You promised! You promised.
448,Thanos,"Oh, daughter. You expect too much from him.  DO IT!!"
449,Peter Quill,I told you to go right.
450,Gamora,"I love you, more than anything."
451,Peter Quill,"I love you, too."
452,Thanos,I like you.
453,Secretary Ross,Still no word from Vision?
454,James Rhodes,Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.
455,Secretary Ross,On a stolen Quinjet with four of the world's most wanted criminals.
456,James Rhodes,"You know they're only criminals because you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?"
457,Secretary Ross,"My God, Rhodes, your talent for horseshit rivals my own."
458,James Rhodes,"If it weren't for those Accords, Vision would've been right here."
459,Secretary Ross,"I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel."
460,James Rhodes,
461,Secretary Ross,You have second thoughts?
462,James Rhodes,Not anymore.
463,Steve Rogers,Mr. Secretary.
464,Secretary Ross,You got some nerve. I'll give you that.
465,Natasha Romanoff,You could use some of that right now.
466,Secretary Ross,"The world's on fire. And you think, all is forgiven?"
467,Steve Rogers,"I'm not looking for forgiveness. And I'm way past asking for permission. Earth just lost her best defender. So we're here to fight.  And if you wanna stand in our way... we'll fight you, too."
468,Secretary Ross,Arrest them.
469,James Rhodes,"All over it.  That's a court-martial. It's great to see you, Cap."
470,Steve Rogers,
471,James Rhodes,Well. You guys really look like crap. Must've been a rough couple of years.
472,Sam Wilson,"Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five star."
473,Bruce Banner,"Uh, I think you look great.   Uh... heh... Yeah. I'm back."
474,Natasha Romanoff,"Hi, Bruce."
475,Bruce Banner,Nat.
476,Sam Wilson,This is awkward.
477,James Rhodes,"So we gotta assume they're coming back, right?"
478,Wanda Maximoff,And they can clearly find us.
479,Bruce Banner,We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?
480,Natasha Romanoff,"After the whole Accords situation, he and Scott took a deal. It was too tough on their families, they're on house arrest."
481,Bruce Banner,Who's Scott?
482,Steve Rogers,Ant-Man.
483,Bruce Banner,"There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man? Okay, look… Thanos has the biggest army in the universe. And he is not gonna stop until he... he gets... Vision's Stone."
484,Natasha Romanoff,"Well then, we have to protect it."
485,Vision,"No, we have to destroy it. I've been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head, about its nature. But also, its composition. I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something, very similar to its own signature, perhaps… its molecular integrity could fail."
486,Wanda Maximoff,"And you, with it. We're not having this conversation."
487,Vision,Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos can't get it.
488,Wanda Maximoff,That's too high a price.
489,Vision,Thanos threatens half the Universe. One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.
490,Steve Rogers,"We don't trade lives, Vision."
491,Vision,"Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life to save how many millions of people. Tell me, why is this any different?"
492,Bruce Banner,"Because you might have a choice. Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, Tony, me, the Stone. All of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another."
493,Wanda Maximoff,You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?
494,Bruce Banner,"I'm saying that if we take out the stone, there's still a whole lot of Vision left. Perhaps the best parts."
495,Natasha Romanoff,Can we do that?
496,Bruce Banner,Not me. Not here.
497,James Rhodes,"You better find someone, and somewhere fast. Ross isn't exactly just gonna let you guys have your old rooms back."
498,Steve Rogers,I know somewhere.

502,Okoye,Those that are left.
503,T'Challa,Send word to the Jabari as well. M'Baku likes a good fight.
504,Okoye,And what of this one?
505,T'Challa,This one may be tired of war.  But the White Wolf has rested long enough.
506,Bucky Barnes,Where's the fight?
507,T'Challa,On its way.
508,Ebony Maw,"In all the time I've served Thanos, I've never failed him. If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan with the Time Stone still attached to your vaguely irritating person, there would be... judgement.  Give me... the stone."
509,Tony Stark,"Wow you're a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?"
510,Peter Parker,"Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty...."
511,Tony Stark,What the--
512,Peter Parker,I know what you're gonna say.
513,Tony Stark,You should not be here.
514,Peter Parker,I was gonna go home--
515,Tony Stark,I don't wanna hear it.
516,Peter Parker,But it was such a long way down and I just thought about you on the way...
517,Tony Stark,And now I gotta hear it.
518,Peter Parker,"...And I kinda stuck to the side of the ship. And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way. So if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here."
519,Tony Stark,What did you just say?
520,Peter Parker,I take that back. And now I'm here in space.
521,Tony Stark,Yeah.  Right where I don't want you to be. This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip. It's a one-way ticket. You hear me? Don't pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through.
522,Peter Parker,No. I did think this through.
523,Tony Stark,You could not have possibly thought this through.
524,Peter Parker,"It's just .. you can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood.  Okay. That didn't really make any sense, but you know what I'm trying to say."
525,Tony Stark,See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan? Go.
526,Peter Parker,"Um. Okay, okay... uh...  Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens?"
527,Ebony Maw,Painful aren't they? They were originally designed for microsurgery. And any one of them...
528,Ebony Maw,...Could end your friend's life in an instant.
529,Tony Stark,"I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy."
530,Ebony Maw,You've saved nothing. Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.
531,Tony Stark,"Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies."
532,Peter Parker,Yes! Wait what are those?!
533,Peter Parker,"Hey, we haven't officially met.  Cool."
534,Stephen Strange,We've gotta turn this ship around.
535,Tony Stark,Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great plan.
536,Stephen Strange,"No, I want to protect the stone."
537,Tony Stark,"And I want you to thank me now. Go ahead, I'm listening."
538,Stephen Strange,For what? Nearly blasting me into space?
539,Tony Stark,Who just saved your magical ass? Me.
540,Stephen Strange,I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet.
541,Tony Stark,Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused.
542,Stephen Strange,"Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you."
543,Tony Stark,"And due to that fact, we're now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup."
544,Peter Parker,I'm backup.
545,Tony Stark,No. You're a stowaway.  The adults are talking.
546,Stephen Strange,"I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here. Wh-- what is he, your ward?"
547,Peter Parker,"No. I'm Peter, by the way."
548,Stephen Strange,Dr. Strange.
549,Peter Parker,"Oh, we're using our made-up names. Um... I'm Spider-Man, then."
550,Tony Stark,This ship is self-correcting its course. Thing's on autopilot.
551,Stephen Strange,Stark?
552,Tony Stark,Yeah?
553,Stephen Strange,Can you get us home?
554,Tony Stark,Yeah I heard you. I'm thinking... I'm not so sure we should.
555,Stephen Strange,Under no circumstance can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos. I don't think you quite understand what's at stake here.
556,Tony Stark,"No. It's you who doesn't understand, that Thanos has been inside my head for six years since he sent an army to New York and now he's back! And I don't know what to do. So I'm not so sure if it's a better plan to fight him on our turf or his but you saw what they did, what they can do. At least on his turf, he's not expecting it. So I say we take the fight to him. Doctor. Do you concur?"
557,Stephen Strange,"Alright, Stark. We go to him. But you have to understand... if it comes to saving you or the kid or the Time Stone... I will not hesitate to let either of you die. I can't, because the fate of the universe depends on it."
558,Tony Stark,Nice. Good. Moral compass. We're straight.
559,Thanos,I thought you might be hungry.
560,Gamora,I always hated that chair.
561,Thanos,So I've been told. Even so. I'd hoped you'd sit on it one day.
562,Gamora,I hated this room. This ship. I hated my life.
563,Thanos,You told me that too.  Every day. For almost twenty years.
564,Gamora,I was a child when you took me.
565,Thanos,I saved you.
566,Gamora,No. No. We were happy on my home planet.
567,Thanos,"Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that. Do you know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise."
568,Gamora,Because you murdered half the planet.
569,Thanos,A small price to pay for salvation.
570,Gamora,You're insane.
571,Thanos,"Little one, it's a simple calculus. This universe is finite, its resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction."
572,Gamora,You don't know that!
573,Thanos,For a time... you had that same will... as you fought by my side. Daughter.
574,Gamora,I'm not your daughter. Everything I hate about myself you taught me.
575,Thanos,"And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone."
576,Gamora,I'm sorry I disappointed you.
577,Thanos,I am disappointed. But not because you didn't find it.  And you lied.
578,Gamora,Nebula.
579,Gamora,Don't do this.
580,Thanos,"Some time ago, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me."
581,Gamora,Please don't do this.
582,Thanos,And very nearly succeeded. So I brought her here. To talk.
583,Gamora,Stop. Stop it.  I swear to you on my life. I never found the Soul Stone.
584,Memory Nebula,"You know what he's about to do. He's finally ready, and he's going for the stones. All of them."
585,Memory Gamora,He can never get them all.
586,Memory Nebula,He will!
587,Memory Gamora,"He can't, Nebula. Because I found the map to the Soul Stone and I burnt it to ash. I burnt it."
588,Thanos,
589,Gamora,Vormir!  The Stone is on Vormir.
590,Thanos,Show me.
591,Groot,I am Groot.
592,Rocket,Tinkle in the cup. We're not looking. What's there to see? What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig.
593,Groot,I am Groot.
594,Thor,"Tree, pour what's in the cup out in space, and go in the cup again."
595,Rocket,You speak Groot?
596,Thor,"Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective."
597,Groot,I am Groot.
598,Thor,You'll know when we're there. Nivadellir's forge harnesses the power of a blazing neutron star.  It's the birth place of my hammer. It's truly awesome.
599,Rocket,"So, dead brother, huh? Yeah, that can be annoying."
600,Thor,"Well, he's been dead before, but this time I think it really might be true."
601,Rocket,And you said your sister and your dad?
602,Thor,Both dead.
603,Rocket,"Still got a mom, though?"
604,Thor,Killed by a dark elf.
605,Rocket,A best friend?
606,Thor,Stabbed through the heart.
607,Rocket,Are you sure you're up to this particular murder mission?
608,Thor,"Absolutely. Rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret... they're all tremendous motivators. They really clear the mind. So I'm good to go."
609,Rocket,"Yeah, but this Thanos we're talking about... he's the toughest there is."
610,Thor,"Well, he's never fought me."
611,Rocket,"Yeah, he has!"
612,Thor,"He's never fought me twice. And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget."
613,Rocket,Better be some hammer.
614,Thor,"You know, I'm 1,500 years old. I've killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I'm only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is the latest in a long line of bastards and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate wills it so."
615,Rocket,And what if you're wrong?
616,Thor,If I'm wrong then... what more could I lose?
617,Rocket,
618,Thor,What's this?
619,Rocket,What's it look like? Some jerk lost a bet with me on on Contraxia.
620,Thor,He gave you his eye?
621,Rocket,He gave me 100 credits. I snuck in later that night and stole his eye.
622,Thor,"Thank you, sweet rabbit."
623,Rocket,"Hmm. Huh? Oh. I would've washed that. The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my... Hey, we're here!"
624,Thor,I don't think this thing works. Everything seems dark.
625,Rocket,It ain't the eye.
626,Thor,Something's wrong. The star's gone out. And the rings are frozen.
627,"[The pod flies through massive machinery, cold and inert. Screen title",NIDAVELLIR]
628,Rocket,I hope these dwarves are better at forging than they are cleaning. Maybe they realized they live in a junk pile in the middle of space.
629,Thor,This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries....
630,Rocket,"You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?"
631,Thor,Yes. Why?
632,Rocket,Look anything like that?
633,Groot,I am Groot.
634,Thor,Go back to the pod.
635,Thor,"Eitri, wait! Stop!"
636,Eitri,Thor?
637,Thor,What happened here?
638,Eitri,You were supposed to protect us. Asgard was supposed to protect us!
639,Thor,"Asgard is destroyed.  Eitri, the glove. What did you do?"
640,Eitri,
641,Thor,"Eitri, this isn't about your hands. Every weapon you've ever designed... every ax, hammer, sword... it's all inside your head. Now I know it feels like all hope is lost. Trust me, I know. But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos."
642,Nebula,"Mantis, listen very carefully. I need you to meet me on Titan."
643,Peter Parker,"Hey, what's going on?"
644,Stephen Strange,I think we're here.
645,Tony Stark,I don't think this rig has a self-park function.  Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it. You understand?
646,Peter Parker,"Yep, got it."
647,Tony Stark,"This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta to move at the same time."
648,Peter Parker,Okay. Okay. Ready.
649,Peter Parker,We might wanna turn. Turn! Turn! Turn!!
650,"[The ship, now reduced to about 45%, plows through the dirt and stops, leaning slightly to one side. Screen title",TITAN.]
651,Tony Stark,That was close. I owe you one.
652,Peter Parker,"Let me just say, if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something, and I eat one of you, I'm sorry."
653,Tony Stark,I don't wanna hear another single pop culture out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?
654,Peter Parker,I'm trying to say that... something is coming.
655,Drax,
656,Peter Parker,"AH! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! PLEASE DON'T PUT YOUR EGGS IN ME!"
657,Peter Quill,"Stay down, clown!"
658,Drax,"Die, blanket of death!"
659,Peter Quill,"Alright, everybody, stay where you are... chill the F out.  I'm gonna ask you this one time. Where's Gamora?"
660,Tony Stark,"Yeah, I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?"
661,Drax,I'll do you one better! Why is Gamora?!
662,Peter Quill,"Tell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, I'm gonna French-fry this little freak."
663,Tony Stark,"Let's do it! You shoot my guy, I blast him. Let's go!"
664,Drax,"Do it, Quill! I can take it."
665,Mantis,"No, he can't take it!"
666,Stephen Strange,She's right. You can't.
667,Peter Quill,Oh yeah? You don't wanna tell me where she is? That's fine. I'll kill all three of you and beat it out of Thanos myself.  Starting with you.
668,Stephen Strange,"Wait, what. Thanos?  Alright, let me ask you this one time: What master do you serve?"
669,Peter Quill,"What master do I serve? What am I supposed to say? ""Jesus""?"
670,Tony Stark,You're from Earth?
671,Peter Quill,I'm not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.
672,Tony Stark,"Yeah, that's on EARTH, dip-shit. What are you hassling us for?"
673,Peter Parker,"So, you're not with Thanos?"
674,Peter Quill,"WITH Thanos?! No, I'm here to kill Thanos! He took my girl- Wai- who are you?"
675,Peter Parker,"We're the Avengers, man."
676,Peter Quill,Oh.
677,Mantis,You're the ones Thor told us about!
678,Tony Stark,You know Thor!?
679,Peter Quill,"Yeah. Tall guy, not that good-looking,  needed saving."
680,Doctor Strange,Where is he now?
681,Rocket,This is plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?
682,Eitri,"It's a mold. A king's weapon. Meant to be the greatest in Asgard. In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost."
683,Thor,Did it have a name?
684,Eitri,Stormbreaker.
685,Rocket,That's a bit much.
686,Thor,So how do we make it?
687,Eitri,You'll have to restart the forge. Awaken the heart of a dying star.
688,Thor,"Rabbit, fire up the pod."
689,Peter Quill,The heck happened to this planet? It's eight degrees off its axis. Gravitational pull is all over the place.
690,Tony Stark,"Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us. We'll use it. All right, I have a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one. It's pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy. We just want the gauntlet."
691,Tony Stark,"Are you yawning? In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?"
692,Drax,"I stopped listening after you said, ""We need a plan."""
693,Tony Stark,"Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page."
694,Peter Quill,"See, ""not winging it"" isn't really what they do."
695,Peter Parker,"Uh, what exactly is it that they do?"
696,Mantis,"Kick names, take ass."
697,Drax,"Yeah, that's right."
698,Tony Stark,"Alright, just get over here, please. Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?"
699,Peter Quill,"""Mr. Lord."" Star-Lord is fine."
700,Tony Stark,We gotta coalesce. 'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude....
701,Peter Quill,"Dude, don't call us plucky. We don't know what it means. Alright, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan. Except it sucks, so let me do the plan, and that way it might be really good."
702,Drax,Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.
703,Tony Stark,What dance-off?
704,Peter Quill,It's not a... it's not... it's nothing.
705,Peter Parker,"Like in Footloose, the movie?"
706,Peter Quill,Exactly like Footloose. Is it still the greatest movie in history?
707,Peter Parker,It never was.
708,Tony Stark,"Don't encourage this, alright?"
709,Peter Parker,Okay.
710,Tony Stark,We're getting no help from Flash Gordon here.
711,Peter Quill,"Flash Gordon? By the way, that's a compliment. Don't forget, I'm half human.  So that 50% of me that's stupid? That's 100% you."
712,Tony Stark,Your math is blowing my mind.
713,Mantis,"Excuse me, but... does your friend often do that?"
714,Tony Stark,Strange! We alright?
715,Tony Stark,You're back. You're alright.
716,Peter Parker,"Hey, what was that?"
717,Stephen Strange,I went forward in time to view alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.
718,Peter Quill,How many did you see?
719,Stephen Strange,"14,000,605."
720,Tony Stark,How many did we win?
721,Stephen Strange,One.
722,"[Cut to Thanos and Gamora appearing on sand dunes alternating with shallow pools around the base of a mountain. The sun is in full eclipse, lending eerie lighting to the scene. Screen title",VORMIR]
723,Thanos,The stone had better be up there... for your sister's sake.
724,Stonekeeper,"Welcome, Thanos, son of A'lars. Gamora, daughter of Thanos."
725,Thanos,You know us?
726,Stonekeeper,It is my curse to know all who journey here.
727,Thanos,Where's the Soul Stone?
728,Stonekeeper,You should know... it extracts a terrible price.
729,Thanos,I am prepared.
730,Stonekeeper,We all think that at first.  We are all wrong.
731,Thanos,How is it you know this place so well?
732,Red Skull,"A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones. I even held one in my hand. But it cast me out, banished me here. Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess."
733,Red Skull,What you seek lies before you. As does what you fear.
734,Thanos,What's this?
735,Red Skull,The price. Soul hold a special place among the Infinity Stones. You might say it has a certain wisdom.
736,Thanos,Tell me what it needs.
737,Red Skull,To ensure that whoever possesses it... understands its power.... The stone demands a sacrifice.
738,Thanos,Of what?
739,Red Skull,In order to take the stone you must lose that which you love. A soul... for a soul.
740,Gamora,"All my life, I dreamed of a day... a moment when you would get what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now... you kill and torture... and you call it mercy. The universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize, and it told you no. You failed. And do you wanna know why? Because you love nothing. No one."
741,Thanos,
742,Gamora,Really? Tears?
743,Red Skull,They're not for him.
744,Gamora,No. This isn't love.
745,Thanos,
746,Gamora,NO!
747,Steve Rogers,"Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0."
748,Sam Wilson,"I hope you're right about this, Cap. Or we're gonna land a lot faster than you want to."
749,Okoye,When you said we were going to open Wakanda to the rest of the world... this is not what I imagined.
750,T'Challa,And what did you imagine?
751,Okoye,The Olympics. Maybe even a Starbucks.
752,Bruce Banner,Should we bow?
753,James Rhodes,"Yeah, he's a king."
754,Steve Rogers,Seems like I'm always thanking you for something.
755,James Rhodes,What are you doing?
756,T'Challa,"Uh, we don't do that here.  So how big of an assault can we expect?"
757,Bruce Banner,"Uh, sir, I think you can expect quite a big assault."
758,Natasha Romanoff,How we looking?
759,King T'Challa,"You will have my Kingsguard, the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and..."
760,Bucky Barnes,"A semi-stable, 100-year-old man."
761,Steve Rogers,"How you been, Buck?"
762,Bucky Barnes,"Uh, not bad, for the end of the world."
763,Shuri,Whoa. The structure is polymorphic.
764,Bruce Banner,"Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially."
765,Shuri,Why didn't you just reprogram the synapses to work collectively?
766,Bruce Banner,"Because, we didn't think of it."
767,Shuri,I'm sure you did your best.
768,Wanda Maximoff,Can you do it?
769,Shuri,"Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here. One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures.  It will take time, brother."
770,Steve Rogers,How long?
771,Shuri,As long as you can give me.
772,Okoye,Something's entered the atmosphere.
773,Sam Wilson,"Hey, Cap, we got a situation here."
774,Bucky Barnes,"God, I love this place."
775,James Rhodes,"Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys. We got more incoming outside the dome."
776,Vision,It's too late. We need to destroy the stone now.
777,Natasha Romanoff,"Vision, get your ass back on the table."
778,T'Challa,We will hold them off.
779,Steve Rogers,"Wanda, as soon as the stone's out of his head... you blow it to hell."
780,Wanda Maximoff,I will.
781,T'Challa,Evacuate the city. Engage all defense procedures.  And get this man a shield.
782,Rocket,"I don't think you get the scientifics here. These rings are gigantic. You wanna get them moving, you're gonna need something a lot bigger to yank 'em loose."
783,Thor,Leave that to me.
784,Rocket,"Leave that to you? Buddy, you're in space. All you got is a rope and a--"
785,Thor,Fire the engines!
786,Rocket,Nnnyah!
787,Thor,MORE... POWER... RABBIT!
788,Eitri,"Well done, boy."
789,Thor,That's Nivadellir!
790,Eitri,Damn it.
791,Rocket,"""Damn it""? What's ""damn it""?"
792,Eitri,The mechanism is crippled.
793,Thor,What?
794,Eitri,With the iris closed I can't heat the metal.
795,Thor,How long will it take to heat?
796,Eitri,"A few minutes, maybe more. Why?"
797,Thor,I'm gonna hold it open.
798,Eitri,That's suicide.
799,Thor,So is facing Thanos without that ax.
800,Natasha Romanoff,"How we looking, Bruce?"
801,Bruce Banner,I'm okay. I'm okay.
802,James Rhodes,I got two heat signatures breaking through the tree line.
803,Jabari Warriors,MIE EFFA!  YA HU! MIE EFFA! YA HU! MIE EFFA! YA HU! MIE EFFA! YA HU! MIE EFFA! YA HU!
804,T'Challa,Thank you for standing with us.
805,M'Baku,"Of course, brother."
806,Natasha Romanoff,Where's your other friend?
807,Proxima Midnight,You will pay for his life with yours. Thanos will have that stone.
808,Steve Rogers,That's not gonna happen.
809,T'Challa,You are in Wakanda now. Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood.
810,Proxima Midnight,We... have blood to spare.
811,Bucky Barnes,Did they surrender?
812,Steve Rogers,Not exactly.
813,Bucky Barnes,What the hell.
814,Natasha Romanoff,Looks like we pissed her off.
815,Okoye,They're killing themselves.
816,Sam Wilson,You seen the teeth on those things?
817,James Rhodes,"Alright, back up, Sam. You're gonna get your wings singed."
818,Bruce Banner,"Cap, if these things circle the perimeter and get in behind us... there's nothing between them and Vision."
819,Steve Rogers,Them we better keep 'em in front of us.
820,Okoye,How do we do that?
821,T'Challa,"We open the barrier.  On my signal, open North-West Section Seventeen."
822,Dome Control,"Requesting confirmation, my King. You said open the barrier?"
823,T'Challa,On my signal.
824,M'Baku,This will be the end of Wakanda.
825,Okoye,Then it will be the noblest ending in history.
826,T'Challa,WAKANDA FOREVER!  Now!
827,T'Challa,"How much longer, Shuri?"
828,Shuri,"We've barely begun, brother."
829,T'Challa,You might want to pick up the pace.
830,Thor,"Allfathers, give me strength."
831,Eitri,"You understand, boy? You're about to take the full force of a star. It'll kill you."
832,Thor,Only if I die.
833,Eitri,"Yes. That's what... ""killing you"" means."
834,Eitri,"Hold it! Hold it, Thor!"
835,Rocket,
836,Rocket,I think he's dying!
837,Eitri,"He needs the ax! Where's the handle? Tree, help me find the handle!"
838,Bruce Banner,There’s too many of them! GYAH! AAAAHHHHH!
839,Bruce Banner,AH-hahaha! You guys are so screwed now!
840,Thor,BRING ME THANOS!
841,Stephen Strange,"Oh, yeah, you're much more of a ""Thanos."""
842,Thanos,"I take it the Maw is dead. This day extracts a heavy toll. Still, he accomplished his mission."
843,Stephen Strange,You may regret that. He brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.
844,Thanos,And where do you think he brought you?
845,Stephen Strange,Let me guess. Your home?
846,Thanos,"Titan was like most planets. Too many mouths, and not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution."
847,Stephen Strange,Genocide.
848,Thanos,"But at random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike. They called me a madman. And what I predicted came to pass."
849,Stephen Strange,Congratulations. You're a prophet.
850,Thanos,I'm a survivor.
851,Stephen Strange,Who wants to murder trillions.
852,Thanos,"With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers, and they would all cease to exist. I call that... mercy."
853,Stephen Strange,And then what?
854,Thanos,I finally rest... and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe. The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
855,Stephen Strange,I think... you'll find... our will... equal to yours.
856,Thanos,Ours?
857,Tony Stark,"Piece of cake, Quill."
858,Peter Quill,"Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off!"
859,Peter Quill,Boom!
860,Stephen Strange,
861,Peter Parker,Magic!  Magic with a--
862,Thanos,Insect!
863,Thanos,"Well, well."
864,Nebula,You should have killed me.
865,Thanos,Would've been a waste of parts!
866,Nebula,Where's Gamora?!
867,Tony Stark,Is he under? Don't let up.
868,Mantis,Be quick. He is very strong.
869,Tony Stark,"Parker, help! Get over here.  She can't hold him much longer. Let's go."
870,Peter Quill,"I thought you'd be harder to catch. For the record, this was my plan. Not so strong now, huh? Where is Gamora?"
871,Thanos,My... Gamora...?
872,Peter Quill,"No, bullshit. Where is she?"
873,Mantis,He is in anguish.
874,Peter Quill,Good.
875,Mantis,He… he… mourns.
876,Drax,What does this monster have to mourn?!
877,Nebula,Gamora.
878,Peter Quill,What?
879,Nebula,He took her to Vormir. He came back with the Soul Stone... but she didn't.
880,Tony Stark,"Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now, you understand?"
881,Tony Stark,"Don't, don't, don't engage, we've almost got this off!"
882,Peter Quill,Tell me she's lying.  ASSHOLE! Tell me you didn't do it!
883,Thanos,I... had... to.
884,Peter Quill,"NO, YOU DIDN'T!"
885,Tony Stark & Drax,Quill!
886,Tony Stark,"Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop! Hey, stop! Stop!"
887,Peter Parker,It's coming! It's coming! It's coming!  I got it! I got it.... !
888,Peter Parker,
889,Rocket,How much for the gun?
890,Bucky Barnes,Not for sale.
891,Rocket,"Okay, how much for the arm?  Oh, I'll get that arm."
892,Steve Rogers,New haircut?
893,Thor,Notice you've copied my beard.
894,Thor,"By the way, this is a friend of mine. Tree."
895,Groot,I am GROOT!
896,Steve Rogers,I... I am Steve Rogers.
897,T'Challa,Fall back! Fall back now!
898,James Rhodes,"Focus that fire on the left flank, Sam."
899,Sam Wilson,I'm doing it.
900,Okoye,Why was she up there all this time?
901,Proxima Midnight,She's on the field. Take it.
902,Sam Wilson,"Guys, we got a Vision situation here."
903,Steve Rogers,Somebody get to Vision!
904,Bruce Banner,I got him!
905,Wanda Maximoff,On my way.
906,Proxima Midnight,He'll die alone. As will you.
907,Natasha Romanoff,She's not alone.
908,Proxima Midnight,Euuyaaah!
909,Bruce Banner,"Oh no, oh no you don't. This isn't going to be like New York, pal. This suit's already kicked the crap out of the Hulk--"
910,Bruce Banner,Guys! Vision needs backup now!  Ahhhhh! Hulk! Hulk! HULK!
911,Hulk,NOOOO!!!
912,Bruce Banner,"Oh, screw you, you big green asshole! I'll do it myself!  Come on!"
913,Bruce Banner,"See ya!  Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal."
914,Corvus Glaive,"I thought you were formidable, machine. But you're dying, like any man."
915,Steve Rogers,Get outta here!  GO!
916,Natasha Romanoff,That was really gross.
917,Steve Rogers,I thought I told you to go.
918,Vision,"We don't trade lives, Captain."
919,Peter Parker,
920,Thanos,"You're full of tricks, wizard."
921,Stephen Strange,No!
922,Thanos,
923,Tony Stark,"You throw another moon at me, and I'm gonna to lose it."
924,Thanos,Stark.
925,Tony Stark,You know me?
926,Thanos,I do. You're not the only one cursed with knowledge.
927,Tony Stark,My only curse is you.
928,Thanos,Come on!
929,Thanos,All that for a drop of blood.
930,Thanos,"You have my respect, Stark. When I'm done, half of humanity will still be alive.  I hope they remember you."
931,Stephen Strange,Stop!  Spare his life... and I will give you the stone.
932,Thanos,No tricks.
933,Tony Stark,Don't... !
934,Thanos,One to go.
935,Peter Quill,
936,Peter Quill,Where is he?!
937,Peter Quill,Did we just lose?
938,Tony Stark,Why would you do that?
939,Stephen Strange,We're in the Endgame now.
940,M'Baku,MAYEFA!
941,Jabari Warriors,YA HU HU!
942,Wanda Maximoff,What? What is it?
943,Vision,He's here.
944,Steve Rogers,"Everyone, on my position. We have incoming."
945,Natasha Romanoff,What the hell?
946,Bruce Banner,Cap. That's him.
947,Steve Rogers,Eyes up. Stay sharp.
948,Vision,Wanda. It's time.
949,Wanda Maximoff,No.
950,Vision,"They can't stop him, Wanda, but we can. Look at me. You have the power to destroy the stone."
951,Wanda Maximoff,Don't.
952,Vision,"You must do it. Wanda, please. We. Are. Out of time."
953,Wanda Maximoff,I can't.
954,Vision,"Yes, you can. You can. If he gets the stone, half the universe dies."
955,Wanda Maximoff,It's not fair.
956,Vision,"It shouldn't be you, but it is. It's all right. You could never hurt me. I just... feel you."
957,Vision,It's all right. It's all right. I love you.
958,Thanos,"I understand, my child. Better than anyone."
959,Wanda Maximoff,You could never.
960,Thanos,
961,Wanda Maximoff,No!
962,Thor,
963,Thanos,
964,Thor,NO!
965,Thanos,Daughter?
966,Gamora,Did you do it?
967,Thanos,Yes.
968,Gamora,What did it cost?
969,Thanos,Everything.
970,Thor,What'd you do?  WHAT'D YOU DO?!
971,Steve Rogers,Where'd he go? Thor... where'd he go?
972,Bucky Barnes,Steve?
973,T'Challa,
974,Okoye,Kumkani?!
975,Groot,
976,Rocket,"No... no. No. No. No! Groot, no..."
977,James Rhodes,"Sam, where you at?!"
978,Mantis,Something's... happening.
979,Drax,Quill?
980,Tony Stark,"Steady, Quill."
981,Peter Quill,"Oh, man."
982,Stephen Strange,
983,Peter Parker,I don't feel so good...
984,Tony Stark,You're all right?
985,Peter Parker,
986,Nebula,He did it.
987,James Rhodes,What is this? What the hell is happening?
988,Steve Rogers,"Oh, God."
989,Nick Fury,Still no word from Stark?
990,Maria Hill,"No, not yet. We're watching every satellite in both hemispheres, there's still nothing."
991,Nick Fury,What is it?
992,Maria Hill,Multiple bogeys over Wakanda.
993,Nick Fury,Same energy signatures as New York?
994,Maria Hill,Ten times bigger.
995,Nick Fury,Tell Klein. We'll meet him at- -
996,Maria Hill,
997,Nick Fury,They okay?
998,Maria Hill,There's no one here.
999,Nick Fury,Call Control. Code Red.
1000,Maria Hill,Nick?
1001,Nick Fury,Hill?
1002,Nick Fury,"Oh, no. Motherf--"
0,CUT TO,"EXT. THRONE ROOM, SPACE ­ NIGHT"
1,THE OTHER,"The tesseract has awakened. It is on a little world. A human world. They would wield its power,..."
2,Loki,
3,THE OTHER,"But our ally knows its workings as they never will. He is ready to lead. And our force, our Chitauri, will follow."
4,THE OTHER,"The world will be his. The universe yours. And the humans, what can they do but burn?"
5,NICK FURY,How bad is it?
6,AGENT PHIL COULSON,That's the problem sir. We don't know.
7,COULSON,Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from the Tesseract four hours ago.
8,FURY,NASA didn't authorise Selvig to test phase.
9,COULSON,"He wasn't testing it, he wasn't even in the room. Spontaneous advancement."
10,AGENT MARIA HILL,It just turned itself on?
11,FURY,What are the energy levels
12,COULSON,"Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down, we ordered evac."
13,FURY,How long to get everyone out?
14,COULSON,Campus should be clear in the next half hour.
15,FURY,Do better.
16,HILL,"Sir, evacuation may be futile."
17,FURY,We should tell them to go back to sleep?
18,HILL,"If we can't control the Tesseract's energy, there may not be a minimum safe distance."
19,FURY,I need you to make sure Phase 2 prototypes are shipped out.
20,HILL,"Sir, is that really a priority right now?"
21,FURY,"Until such a time as the world ends, we will act as though it intends to spin on. Clear out the tech below. Every peice of Phase 2 on a truck and gone."
22,HILL,Yes sir.  With me.
23,FURY,Talk to me doctor.
24,Dr. ERIK SELVIG,Director.
25,FURY,Is there anything we know for certain?
26,SELVIG,The Tesseract is misbehaving.
27,FURY,Is that supposed to be funny?
28,SELVIG,"No, it's not funny at all. The Tesseract is not only active, she's... misbehaving."
29,FURY,How soon until you pull the plug?
30,SELVIG,"She's an energy source. If we turn off the power, she turns it back on. If she reaches peak level..."
31,FURY,We've prepared for this doctor. Harnessing energy from space.
32,SELVIG,"We don't have the harness. Our calculations are far from complete. Now she's throwing off interference, radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation."
33,FURY,That can be harmful. Where's Barton?
34,SELVIG,"The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual"
35,FURY,"Agent Barton, report."
36,FURY,I gave you this detail so you could keep a close eye on things.
37,CLINT BARTON,"Well, I see better from a distance."
38,FURY,Are you seeing anything that might set this thing off?
39,NASA SCIENCETIST,"Doctor, it's spiking again."
40,CLINT,"No one's come or gone. It's oven is clean. No contancts, no I.M.'s. If there was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at this end."
41,FURY,At this end?
42,CLINT,"Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right? The doors open from both sides."
43,FURY,Sir please put down the spear.
44,LOKI,You have heart.
45,LOKI,Please don't. I still need that.
46,FURY,This doesn't have to get any messier.
47,LOKI,"Of course it does. I've come too far for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard, and I am burdened with glorious purpose."
48,SELVIG,Loki? Brother of Thor?
49,FURY,We have no quarrel with your people.
50,LOKI,An ant had no quarrel with a boot.
51,FURY,You planning to step on us?
52,LOKI,"I come with glad tidings, of a world made free."
53,FURY,Free from what?
54,LOKI,"Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie. Once you accept that, in your heart..."
55,LOKI,You will know peace.
56,FURY,"Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think you mean the other thing."
57,CLINT,"Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This place is about to blow. Drop a hundred feet of rock on us. He means to bury us."
58,FURY,Like the Pharaohs of Odin.
59,SELVIG,He's right. The portal is collapsing in on itself. You got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.
60,LOKI,Well then.
61,CLINT,Need these vehicles.
62,HILL,Who's that?
63,CLINT,He didn't tell me.
64,FURY,"Hill, do you copy?"
65,FURY,Barton is...
66,FURY,He's got the Tesseract! Track it down!
67,COULSON,No! Leave it!
68,COULSON,"You're clear, sir! You need to go!"
69,COULSON,"Director? Director Fury, do you copy?"
70,FURY,The tesseract is with the hostile force. I have men down. Hill?
71,HILL,"A lot of men still under, don't know how many survivors."
72,FURY,Sound the general call. I want every living soul not working rescue looking for that briefcase.
73,HILL,Roger that.
74,FURY,"Coulson, get back to base. This is a Level Seven. As of right now, we are at war."
75,COULSON,What do we do?
76,GENERAL LUCHKOV,This is not how I wanted the evening to go.
77,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I know how you wanted this evening to go. Believe me, this is better."
78,LUCHKOV,"I'd like to know why they sent you to carry out a carrier, a stained glass and other random items."
79,NATASHA,I thought General Solohob was in charge of the export business.
80,LUCHKOV,Solohob? Your reputation is quite a progression. The famous Black Widow. Nothing but a pretty face.
81,NATASHA,You really think I'm pretty?
82,LUCHKOV,"We do not need the Lermontov to transfer the tanks. Tell him, well...  You may have to write it down."
83,WEASELY THUG,Ya?  It's for you.
84,LUCHKOV,Who the hell is...
85,COULSON,"You're at 114 Solenski Plaza, 3rd floor. We have an F22 exactly 8 miles out. Put the woman on the phone or I will blow up the block before you can make the lobby."
86,COULSON,We need you to come in.
87,NATASHA,Are you kidding? I'm working!
88,COULSON,This takes precedence.
89,NATASHA,I'm in the middle of an interrogation and this moron is giving me everything.
90,LUCHKOV,I don't give everything.
91,NATASHA,"Look, you can't pull me out of this right now."
92,COULSON,Natasha. Barton's been compromised.
93,NATASHA,Let me put you on hold.
94,NATASHA,Where's Barton now?
95,COULSON,We don't know.
96,NATASHA,But he's alive.
97,COULSON,"We think so. I'll brief you on everything when you get back. But first, we need you to talk to the big guy."
98,NATASHA,"Coulson, you know that Stark only trusts me about as far as he can throw me."
99,COULSON,"No, I've got Stark. You get the big guy."
100,NATASHA,
101,ATTENDING WOMAN,What are you doing here?! Get out! You shouldn't be here.
102,LITTLE GIRL,I have to see the doctor. It's my father.
103,BRUCE,Calm down. What's wrong?
104,LITTLE GIRL,My father...
105,BRUCE,Is he like them?
106,LITTLE GIRL,Please.
107,BRUCE,"Should have gotten paid up front, Banner."
108,NATASHA,"You know, for a man who's supposed to be avoiding stress, you picked a hell of a place to settle."
109,BRUCE,Avoiding stress isn't the secret.
110,NATASHA,"Then, what is it? Yoga?"
111,BANNER,"You brought me to the edge of the city, smart. I uh... assume the whole place is surrounded?"
112,NATASHA,Just you and me.
113,BRUCE,"And your actress buddy, is she a spy too? Do they start that young?"
114,NATASHA,I did.
115,BRUCE,Who are you?
116,NATASHA,Natasha Romanoff.
117,BRUCE,"Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff? Because that's not gonna work out for everyone."
118,NATASHA,No. No. Of course not. I'm here on behalf of SHIELD.
119,BRUCE,SHIELD. How did they find me?
120,NATASHA,"We never lost you, doctor. We've kept our distance, even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent."
121,BRUCE,Why?
122,NATASHA,Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now I need you to come in.
123,BRUCE,What if I said no?
124,NATASHA,I'll persuade you.
125,BRUCE,And what if the... other guy says no?
126,NATASHA,You've been more than a year without an incident. I don't think you wanna break that streak.
127,BRUCE,I don't always get what I want.
128,NATASHA,"Doctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe."
129,BRUCE,"Well, those I actively try to avoid."
130,NATASHA,This is the Tesseract. It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.
131,BRUCE,What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it?
132,NATASHA,"Well, he wants you to find it. It's been taken. It emits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace. There's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do. If there was, that's where I'd be."
133,BRUCE,So Fury isn't after the monster?
134,NATASHA,Not that he's told me.
135,BRUCE,And he tells you everything?
136,NATASHA,"Talk to Fury, he needs you on this."
137,BRUCE,He needs me in a cage?
138,NATASHA,No one's gonna put you in a...
139,BRUCE,STOP LYING TO ME!
140,BRUCE,"I'm sorry, that was mean. I just wanted to see what you'd do. Why don't we do this the easy way, where you don't use that, and the other guy doesn't make a mess? Okay? Natasha..."
141,NATASHA,Stand down. We're good here.
142,BRUCE,Just you and me?
143,COUNCIL MEMBER 1,"This is out of line, Director. You're dealing with forces you can't control."
144,FURY,"You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight? Did you feel an overabundance of control?"
145,COUNCIL MEMBER 1,You saying that this Asgard has declared war on our planet?
146,FURY,"Not Asgard, Loki."
147,COUNCIL MEMBER 2,He can't be working alone. What about the other one? His brother.
148,FURY,"Our intelligence says, Thor is not a hostile. But he's worlds away, we can't depend on him to help. It's up to us."
149,COUNCIL MEMBER 1,"Which is why you should be focusing on phase 2, it was designed for exactly..."
150,FURY,"PHASE 2 isn't ready, our enemy is. We need a response team."
151,COUNCIL MEMBER 1,The Avengers Initiative was shut down.
152,FURY,This isn't about The Avengers.
153,COUNCIL MEMBER 1,We're running the world's greatest covert security network and you're gonna leave the fate of human race to a handful of freaks.
154,FURY,"I'm not leaving anything to anyone. We need a response team. These people maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need."
155,COUNCIL MEMBER 2,You believe?
156,COUNCIL MEMBER 1,"War isn't won by sentiment, Director."
157,FURY,"No, it's won by soldiers."
158,STEVE,There's not enough time! I gotta put her in the water!
159,PEGGY CARTER,You won't be alone.
160,SHIELD SCIENCETIST,Oh my god!
161,SHIELD SCIENCETIST,This guy is still alive!
162,FURY,Trouble sleeping?
163,STEVE,"I slept for seventy years, sir. I think I've had my fill."
164,FURY,"Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world."
165,STEVE,"I went under, the world was at war, I wake up, they say we won. They didn't say what we lost."
166,FURY,We've made some mistakes along the way. Some very recently.
167,STEVE,"You here with a mission, sir?"
168,FURY,I am.
169,STEVE,Trying to get me back in the world?
170,FURY,Trying to save it.
171,STEVE,Hydra's secret weapon.
172,FURY,"Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you. He thought what we think, the Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That's something the world sorely needs."
173,STEVE,Who took it from you?
174,FURY,He's called Loki. He's not from around here. There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know.
175,STEVE,"At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me."
176,FURY,Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a debriefing package waiting for you back at your apartment.
177,FURY,Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now?
178,STEVE,You should have left it in the ocean.
179,TONY,You're good on this end. The rest is up to you.
180,PEPPER POTTS,You disconnected the transition lines? Are we off the grid?
181,TONY,Stark Tower is about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy.
182,PEPPER,"Wow. So maybe our reactor takes over, and it actually works?"
183,TONY,I assume. Light her up.
184,PEPPER,How does it look?
185,TONY,"Like Christmas, but with more... me."
186,TONY,"Pepper, you're killing me. Remember the moment? Enjoy the moment."
187,PEPPER,Then get in here and I will.
188,JARVIS,"Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the line."
189,TONY,I'm not in. I'm actually out.
190,JARVIS,"Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting."
191,TONY,"Grow a spine, Jarvis. I got a date."
192,PEPPER,Levels are holding steady... I think.
193,TONY,"Of course they are, I was directly involved. Which brings me to my next question: how does it feel to be a genius?"
194,PEPPER,"Well, ha, I really wouldn't know now, would I?"
195,TONY,What do you mean? All this came from you.
196,PEPPER,No. All this came from that.
197,TONY,"Give yourself some credit, please. Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself... twelve percent of the credit."
198,PEPPER,Twelve percent?
199,TONY,An argument can be made for fifteen.
200,PEPPER,Twelve percent? For my baby?
201,TONY,"Well, I did do all the heavy lifting. Literally, I lifted the heavy things. And sorry, but the security snafu? That was on you."
202,PEPPER,Oooooh.
203,TONY,My private elevator...
204,PEPPER,You mean our elevator?
205,TONY,"Was steaming with sweaty workmen. I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later, aren't I?"
206,PEPPER,Not gonna be that subtle.
207,TONY,I'll tell you what. Next building's gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.
208,PEPPER,On the lease.
209,TONY,"Call your mom, can you bunk over?"
210,JARVIS,"Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid my protocols are being overwritten."
211,COULSON,"Stark, we need to talk."
212,TONY,"You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark, please leave a message."
213,COULSON,This is urgent.
214,TONY,Then leave it urgently.  That's on you.
215,COULSON,Mr. Stark
216,PEPPER,Phil! Come in.
217,TONY,"Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent."
218,PEPPER,"Come on in, we're celebrating."
219,COULSON,I can't stay
220,TONY,Which is why he can't stay.
221,COULSON,We need you to look this over.  Soon as possible.
222,TONY,I don't like being handed things.
223,PEPPER,"That's alright, 'cause I love to be handed things. So, let's trade.  Thank you."
224,TONY,Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday.
225,COULSON,This isn't a consultation.
226,PEPPER,Is this about The Avengers? Which I...I know nothing about.
227,TONY,"The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought. And I didn't even qualify."
228,PEPPER,I didn't know that either.
229,TONY,"Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed, don't play well with others."
230,PEPPER,That I did know.
231,COULSON,This isn't about personality profiles anymore.
232,TONY,"Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute?"
233,TONY,"You know, I thought we were having a moment."
234,PEPPER,"I was having twelve percent of a moment. This seems serious, Phil's pretty shaken."
235,TONY,How did you notice? Why is he Phil?
236,PEPPER,What is all of this?
237,TONY,"This is, uh...  This."
238,PEPPER,I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight.
239,TONY,Tomorrow.
240,PEPPER,You've got homework. You've got a lot of homework.
241,TONY,"Well, what if I didn't?"
242,PEPPER,If you didn't?
243,TONY,Yeah.
244,PEPPER,You mean if you finished?
245,TONY,Square deal. It's the last date.
246,PEPPER,Work hard.
247,PILOT,"We're about forty minutes out from base, sir."
248,STEVE,"So, this Doctor Banner was trying to replicate the serum that was used on me?"
249,COULSON,A lot of people were. You were the world's first superhero. Banner thought gamma radiation might hold the key to unlocking Erskine's original formula.
250,STEVE,"Didn't really go his way, did it?"
251,COULSON,"Not so much. When he's not that thing though, guy's like a Stephen Hawking.  I mean, I was... I was present while you were unconscious from the ice. You know, it's really, it's just a... just a huge honor to have you on board."
252,STEVE,"Well, I hope I'm the man for the job."
253,COULSON,"Oh, you are. Absolutely. Uh... we've made some modifications to the uniform. I had a little design input."
254,STEVE,The uniform? Aren't the stars and stripes a little... old fashioned?
255,COULSON,"With everything that's happening, the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old fashioned."
256,THE OTHER,The Chitauri grow restless
257,LOKI,Let them go at themselves. I will lead them into glorious battle.
258,THE OTHER,Battle? Against the meager might of Earth?
259,LOKI,"Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is as formidable as you claim."
260,THE OTHER,"You question us? You question him? He who put the scepter in your hand, who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose when you were cast out, defeated?"
261,LOKI,I was a king! The rightful kind of Asgard! Betrayed!
262,THE OTHER,"Your ambition is little, born of childish need. We look beyond the Earth to greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil."
263,LOKI,"You don't have the Tesseract yet.  I don't threaten, but until I open the doors, until your force is mine to command, you are but words."
264,THE OTHER,"You will have your war, Asgardian. If you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from us, there will be no realm, no barren moon, no crevice where he can't find you. You think you know pain? He will make you long for something as sweet as pain."
265,COULSON,"Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers."
266,STEVE,Ma'am?
267,NATASHA,Hi.  They need you on the bridge. They're starting the face-trace.
268,COULSON,See you there.
269,NATASHA,"It was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice. I thought Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?"
270,STEVE,Trading cards?
271,NATASHA,"They're vintage, he's very proud."
272,STEVE,Dr. Banner.
273,BRUCE,"Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be coming."
274,STEVE,Word is you can find the cube.
275,BRUCE,Is that the only word on me?
276,STEVE,Only word I care about.
277,BRUCE,"It must be strange for you, all of this."
278,STEVE,"Well, this is actually kind of familiar."
279,NATASHA,"Gentlemen, you might want to step inside in a minute. It's gonna get a little hard to breath."
280,STEVE,Is this a submarine?
281,BRUCE,"Really? They wanted me in a submerged, pressurized metal container?"
282,BRUCE,"Oh, no. This is much worse."
283,HILL,"We're at lock, sir."
284,FURY,Good. Let's vanish.
285,FURY,"Gentlemen.  Doctor, thank you for coming."
286,BRUCE,"Thanks for asking nicely. So, uh... how long am I staying?"
287,FURY,"Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you're in the clear."
288,BRUCE,Where are you with that?
289,COULSON,"We're sweeping every wirelessly accessible camera on the planet. Cellphones, laptops. If it's connected to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for us."
290,NATASHA,That's still not gonna find them in time.
291,BRUCE,You have to narrow the field. How many spectrometers do you have access to?
292,FURY,How many are there?
293,BRUCE,"Call every lab you know, tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll rough out a tracking algorithm based on cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places. Do you have somewhere for me to work?"
294,FURY,"Agent Romanoff, would you show Dr. Banner to his laboratory, please."
295,NATASHA,"You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys."
296,SELVIG,Put it over there!  Where did you find all these people?
297,CLINT,"SHIELD has not shortage of enemies, Doctor. . Is this the stuff you need?"
298,SELVIG,"Yeah, iridium. It's found in meteorites, it forms anti-protons. It's very hard to get hold of."
299,CLINT,Especially if SHIELD knows you need it.
300,SELVIG,"Well, I didn't know!  Hey! The Tesseract is showing me so much. It's more than just knowledge, it's... truth."
301,LOKI,"I know. What did it show you, Agent Barton?"
302,CLINT,My next target.
303,LOKI,Tell me what you need.
304,CLINT,I'll need a distraction.  And an eyeball.
305,COULSON,"I mean, if it's not too much trouble."
306,STEVE,"No, no. It's fine."
307,COULSON,"It's a vintage set. It took me a couple of years to collect them all. Near mint, slight foxing around the edges, but..."
308,AGENT JASPER SITWELL,"We got a hit. Sixty-seven percent match. Weight, cross match, seventy-nine percent."
309,AGENT PHIL COULSON,Location?
310,SITWELL,"Stuttgart, Germany. 28, Konigstrasse. He's not exactly hiding."
311,FURY,"Captain, you're up."
312,LOKI,"Kneel before me.  Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It's the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel."
313,ELDER GERMAN MAN,Not to men like you.
314,LOKI,There are no men like me.
315,ELDER GERMAN MAN,There are always men like you.
316,LOKI,"Look to your elder, people. Let him be an example."
317,CAPTAIN AMERICA,"You know, the last time I was in Germany and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing."
318,LOKI,The soldier. A man out of time.
319,CAPTAIN AMERICA,I'm not the one who's out of time.
320,NATASHA,"Loki, drop the weapon and stand down."
321,LOKI,Kneel.
322,CAPTAIN AMERICA,Not today!
323,NATASHA,This guy's all over the place.
324,IRON MAN,"Agent Romanoff, did you miss me?  Make your move, Reindeer Games."
325,IRON MAN,Good move.
326,CAPTAIN AMERICA,Mr. Stark.
327,IRON MAN,Captain.
328,NICK FURY,Said anything?
329,NATASHA,Not a word.
330,NICK FURY,Just get him here. We're low on time.
331,STEVE,I don't like it.
332,TONY,What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?
333,STEVE,I don't remember it being ever that easy. This guy packs a wallop.
334,TONY,"Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow. What's your thing? Pilates?"
335,STEVE,What?
336,TONY,"It's like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple things, you know, doing time as a Capsicle."
337,STEVE,Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.
338,TONY,"Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you."
339,NATASHA,Where's this coming from?
340,STEVE,What's the matter? Scared of a little lightning?
341,LOKI,I'm not overly fond of what follows.
342,IRON MAN,Now there's that guy.
343,NATASHA,Another Asgardian?
344,CAPTAIN AMERICA,Think the guy's a friendly?
345,IRON MAN,"Doesn't matter. If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost. Tony turns and gets ready to jump off the jet to chase after Thor."
346,CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Stark, we need a plan of attack!"
347,IRON MAN,I have a plan. Attack.
348,NATASHA,"I'd sit this one out, Cap."
349,CAPTAIN AMERICA,I don't see how I can.
350,NATASHA,"These guys come from legends, they're basically gods."
351,CAPTAIN AMERICA,"There's only one God, ma'am. And I'm  pretty sure he doesn't dress like that."
352,THOR,Where is the Tesseract?
353,LOKI,I missed you too.
354,THOR,Do I look to be in a gaming mood?!
355,LOKI,"Oh, you should thank me. With the Bifrost gone how much dark energy did the Allfather have to muster to conjure you here? Your precious Earth."
356,THOR,I thought you died.
357,LOKI,Did you mourn?
358,THOR,We all did. Our father...
359,LOKI,"Your father. He did tell you my true  parentage, did he not? Thor lets go Loki, who walks away from Thor, causing an even  bigger wedge between them."
360,THOR,"We were raised together, we played together, we fought together. Do you remember none of that?"
361,LOKI,I remember a shadow. Living in the  shade of your greatness. I remember you tossing me into an abyss. I was and should be king!
362,THOR,"So you take the world I love as  recompense for your imagined slights.  No, the Earth is under my protection,  Loki."
363,LOKI,"And you're doing a marvelous job with that. The humans slaughter each other in droves, while you idly threat. I  mean to rule them. And why should I not?"
364,THOR,You think yourself above them.
365,LOKI,"Well, yes."
366,THOR,"Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother. Throne would suit you ill. Angrily, Loki shoves his brother to the side. He walks back up  to the ledge. Turns around."
367,LOKI,"I've seen worlds you've never known about! I have grown, Odinson, in my exile! I have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when I wield it..."
368,THOR,Who showed you this power? Who controls the would-be-king?
369,LOKI,I am a king!
370,THOR,Not here! You give up the Tesseract!  You give up this poisonous dream! You come home.
371,LOKI,"I don't have it. You need the cube to bring me home, but I've sent it off I know not where."
372,THOR,"You listen well, brother. I..."
373,LOKI,I'm listening.
374,THOR,Do not touch me again!
375,TONY,Then don't take my stuff.
376,THOR,You have no idea what you're dealing with.
377,TONY,Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother know you weareth her drapes?
378,THOR,"This is beyond you, metal man. Loki will face Asgardian justice!"
379,TONY,"He gives up the Cube, he's all yours.  Until then, stay out of my way...  tourist.  The IRON MAN helmet clamps up and he walks away. In one quick  move, Thor pulls Mjölnir, throws it, and KNOCKS IRON MAN clear across into a tree."
380,TONY,Okay.
381,JARVIS,Power at 400% capacity.
382,TONY,How about that?
383,CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Hey! That's enough!    Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here."
384,THOR,I've come here to put an end to Loki's schemes!
385,CAPTAIN AMERICA,Then prove it! Put the hammer down.
386,IRON MAN,"Um, yeah, no! Bad call! He loves his hammer!"
387,THOR,You want me to put the hammer down?
388,CAPTAIN AMERICA,Are we done here?
389,NICK FURY,"In case it's unclear. You try to escape. You so much as scratch that glass.  Fury presses a button which OPENS UP a HATCH underneath Loki's  cell. Loki peers as much as he can from the glass. Without seeing, the sounds of GUSTING WIND would make man shit his pants. Not a god, though."
390,LOKI,"It's an impressive cage. Not built, I  think, for me."
391,NICK FURY,"Well, you let me know if Real Power  wants a magazine or something."
392,THOR,"He has an army called the Chitauri.  They're not of Asgard or any world  known. He means to lead them against  your people. They will win him the  earth. In return, I suspect, for the Tesseract."
393,STEVE,An army? From outer space?
394,The Other,"Humans. They are not the cowering wretches we were promised. They stand. They are unruly, and therefore cannot be ruled."
395,The Other,To challenge them is to court...Death.
